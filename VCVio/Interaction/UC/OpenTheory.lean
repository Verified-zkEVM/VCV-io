# Open composition algebra with monoidal coherence

This module defines `OpenTheory`, a boundary-indexed algebra of open systems,
together with a granular hierarchy of lawfulness classes capturing
increasingly strong equational properties. The split mirrors the categorical
distinction between symmetric monoidal, traced symmetric monoidal
(Joyal-Street-Verity), and compact closed categories.

## Operations

* `map` adapts how an exposed boundary is presented.
* `par` places two open systems side by side (tensor of boundaries).
* `wire` internalizes one shared boundary between two open systems.
* `plug` closes an open system against a matching context on the swapped
  boundary.

## Class hierarchy

Data classes (operations beyond the four primitives):

* `HasUnit`: a distinguished `unit : Obj empty` (the monoidal unit).
* `HasIdWire`: a coevaluation `idWire : ∀ Γ, Obj (swap Γ ⊗ Γ)`.

Naturality (Prop classes):

* `IsLawfulMap`: functoriality of `map` (identity and composition).
* `IsLawfulPar`/`IsLawfulWire`/`IsLawfulPlug`: naturality of each combinator
  with respect to boundary adaptation.
* `IsLawful`: bundles all naturality laws.

Symmetric monoidal coherence:

* `IsMonoidal` (extends `IsLawful`, `HasUnit`): associativity, commutativity
  (braiding), and left/right unit laws for `par`.

Trace algebra (JSV traced symmetric monoidal):

* `IsTraced` (extends `IsMonoidal`): wire associativity, par-superposition,
  and wire commutativity.

Compact closure (snake / zig-zag):

* `IsCompactClosed` (extends `IsTraced`, `HasIdWire`): left and right zig-zag
  identities `wire_idWire`/`wire_idWire_right` and `unit_eq` identifying the
  monoidal unit with the trivial coevaluation.

Plug factorization:

* `HasPlugWireFactor` (extends `IsCompactClosed`): `plug` derivable from
  `wire` via the unit, and the two factorization laws relating closure of
  parallel and wired composites to closure of one component.

The chain `IsMonoidal → IsTraced → IsCompactClosed → HasPlugWireFactor` lets
each model declare exactly the strength it can honestly satisfy. The free
models (`Expr.theory`, `Interp.theory`) instantiate the entire chain. The
process-backed `openTheory` in `OpenProcessModel.lean` instantiates only
`IsLawful`; its monoidal coherence and snake equations hold up to
`OpenProcessIso`, not strict equality.

/--
`OpenTheory` is a boundary-indexed algebra of open systems.

For each directed boundary `Δ`, `Obj Δ` is the type of systems that still
expose `Δ` to an external context. The structure then specifies three
primitive composition operations:

* `map` changes how an exposed boundary is presented, without changing the
  internal system;
* `par` places two open systems side by side and exposes the tensor of their
  boundaries;
* `wire` connects one shared boundary between two open systems and leaves the
  remaining outer boundaries exposed; and
* `plug` closes an open system against a matching context on the swapped
  boundary, yielding a closed system.

Lawfulness is stratified into a granular class hierarchy starting at
`IsLawful` and continuing through `IsMonoidal`, `IsTraced`,
`IsCompactClosed`, and `HasPlugWireFactor` (see the module docstring).

Universe polymorphism: one ambient pair of universes for ports and
messages on both sides of every boundary, keeping `PortBoundary.swap` inside
the same family of objects.
-/
structure OpenTheory where
  /--
  `Obj Δ` is the type of open systems exposing boundary `Δ`.

  The boundary is directed: `Δ.In` is what the surrounding context may send
  into the system, and `Δ.Out` is what the system may emit back out.
  -/
  Obj : PortBoundary → Type u

  /--
  Adapt the exposed boundary of an open system along a structural boundary
  morphism.

  This changes only the *presentation* of the boundary. The intended reading is
  that `map φ W` is the same internal system as `W`, but viewed through the
  interface adaptation `φ`.
  -/
  map :
    {Δ₁ Δ₂ : PortBoundary} →
    PortBoundary.Hom Δ₁ Δ₂ →
    Obj Δ₁ →
    Obj Δ₂

  /--
  Place two open systems side by side.

  The resulting system exposes the tensor of the two boundaries: the outside
  world may interact independently with either side.
  -/
  par :
    {Δ₁ Δ₂ : PortBoundary} →
    Obj Δ₁ →
    Obj Δ₂ →
    Obj (PortBoundary.tensor Δ₁ Δ₂)

  /--
  Connect one shared boundary between two open systems.

  If the left system exposes boundary `Δ₁ ⊗ Γ` and the right system exposes
  boundary `swap Γ ⊗ Δ₂`, then `wire` connects the shared middle boundary `Γ`
  internally and leaves only the outer boundaries `Δ₁` and `Δ₂` exposed.

  This is the first local composition primitive beyond plain parallel
  juxtaposition. It is the right operation for assembling open systems
  incrementally without forcing immediate total closure.
  -/
  wire :
    {Δ₁ Γ Δ₂ : PortBoundary} →
    Obj (PortBoundary.tensor Δ₁ Γ) →
    Obj (PortBoundary.tensor (PortBoundary.swap Γ) Δ₂) →
    Obj (PortBoundary.tensor Δ₁ Δ₂)

  /--
  Close an open system against a matching plug.

  If `W : Obj Δ` is an open system and `K : Obj (PortBoundary.swap Δ)` is a
  context exposing the opposite boundary, then `plug W K` is the structurally
  closed result of connecting those two boundaries together.

  This is the minimal closure operation needed for UC-style contextual
  comparison. More general partial internalization operations can be added
  later if they are genuinely needed.

/-! ### Operation-only data classes -/

/--
`HasUnit T` distinguishes a closed object `unit : T.Obj empty`, intended to
play the role of the symmetric monoidal unit.

This is purely a data class. Whether `unit` actually behaves as a left/right
unit for `par` (up to boundary equivalence) is the content of `IsMonoidal`.
-/
class HasUnit (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u}) where
  /-- The distinguished unit object on the empty boundary. -/
  unit : T.Obj PortBoundary.empty

/--
`HasIdWire T` distinguishes a coevaluation morphism on every boundary,
`idWire Γ : T.Obj (swap Γ ⊗ Γ)`, intended to play the role of the categorical
unit of duality between `Γ` and `swap Γ`.

This is purely a data class. Whether `idWire` actually satisfies the
zig-zag (snake) identities is the content of `IsCompactClosed`.
-/
class HasIdWire (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u}) where
  /-- The identity-wire / coevaluation on boundary `Γ`: a process exposing
  `swap Γ ⊗ Γ` that behaves as a bidirectional relay. -/
  idWire : ∀ (Γ : PortBoundary),
    T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor (PortBoundary.swap Γ) Γ)

/-! ### Naturality (functoriality of `map` and naturality of `par`/`wire`/`plug`) -/

/--
`IsLawfulMap T` states that boundary adaptation in `T` behaves functorially.

This is the first law layer for `OpenTheory`, and the one we can state without
committing to any further monoidal/coherence structure on boundaries.
-/
class IsLawfulMap (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u}) :
    Prop where
  /--
  Adapting a system along the identity boundary morphism does nothing.
  -/
  map_id :
    ∀ {Δ : PortBoundary} (W : T.Obj Δ),
      T.map (PortBoundary.Hom.id Δ) W = W

  /--
  Adapting along a composite boundary morphism is the same as adapting in two
  successive steps.
  -/
  map_comp :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Δ₂ Δ₃ : PortBoundary}
      (g : PortBoundary.Hom Δ₂ Δ₃)
      (f : PortBoundary.Hom Δ₁ Δ₂)
      (W : T.Obj Δ₁),
        T.map (PortBoundary.Hom.comp g f) W = T.map g (T.map f W)

/--
`IsLawfulPar T` states that parallel composition in `T` is natural with
respect to boundary adaptation.

This is the first structural law for `par` that does not require introducing a
separate theory of boundary isomorphisms. Associativity and unit laws can be
added later once that boundary-equivalence vocabulary is in place.
-/
class IsLawfulPar (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u}) :
    Prop extends IsLawfulMap T where
  /--
  Mapping a side-by-side composite along a tensor boundary morphism is the same
  as mapping each side independently before composing them in parallel.
  -/
  map_par :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Δ₁' Δ₂ Δ₂' : PortBoundary}
      (f₁ : PortBoundary.Hom Δ₁ Δ₁')
      (f₂ : PortBoundary.Hom Δ₂ Δ₂')
      (W₁ : T.Obj Δ₁)
      (W₂ : T.Obj Δ₂),
        T.map (PortBoundary.Hom.tensor f₁ f₂) (T.par W₁ W₂) =
          T.par (T.map f₁ W₁) (T.map f₂ W₂)

/--
`IsLawfulWire T` states that partial wiring in `T` is natural with respect to
boundary adaptation.

This is the first law for local composition: adapting the still-exposed
left/right outer boundaries can be pushed inside a `wire`.

Transporting the shared middle boundary itself is a subtler question because
`PortBoundary.Hom.swap` is contravariant. The corresponding law should be
stated later using boundary equivalences or a more symmetric vocabulary.
-/
class IsLawfulWire (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u}) :
    Prop extends IsLawfulMap T where
  /--
  Partial wiring is natural in its still-exposed outer boundaries.

  The shared middle boundary is held fixed in this first law layer. That keeps
  the statement well aligned with the variance of `PortBoundary.Hom` while
  still capturing the most important structural behavior of `wire`.
  -/
  map_wire :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Δ₁' Γ Δ₂ Δ₂' : PortBoundary}
      (f₁ : PortBoundary.Hom Δ₁ Δ₁')
      (f₂ : PortBoundary.Hom Δ₂ Δ₂')
      (W₁ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor Δ₁ Γ))
      (W₂ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor (PortBoundary.swap Γ) Δ₂)),
        T.map (PortBoundary.Hom.tensor f₁ f₂) (T.wire W₁ W₂) =
          T.wire
            (T.map (PortBoundary.Hom.tensor f₁ (PortBoundary.Hom.id Γ)) W₁)
            (T.map
              (PortBoundary.Hom.tensor
                (PortBoundary.Hom.id (PortBoundary.swap Γ))
                f₂)
              W₂)

/--
`IsLawfulPlug T` states that plugging in `T` is natural with respect to
boundary adaptation.

This is the first structural law for `plug`: adapting the open side before
closure is equivalent to adapting the matching plug on the swapped boundary.
-/
class IsLawfulPlug (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u}) :
    Prop extends IsLawfulMap T where
  /--
  Boundary adaptation may be pushed across a plug by swapping the same
  adaptation onto the context side.
  -/
  map_plug :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Δ₂ : PortBoundary}
      (f : PortBoundary.Hom Δ₁ Δ₂)
      (W : T.Obj Δ₁)
      (K : T.Obj (PortBoundary.swap Δ₂)),
        T.plug (T.map f W) K =
          T.plug W (T.map (PortBoundary.Hom.swap f) K)

/--
`IsLawful T` is the first bundled law package for an open-composition theory.

At this stage it only records:

* functoriality of `map`,
* naturality of `par`, and
* naturality of `wire`, and
* naturality of `plug`.

Unit, associativity, and symmetry laws for open composition should be added
later, once the library settles on the right notion of boundary equivalence.
-/
class IsLawful (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u}) :
    Prop extends IsLawfulPar T, IsLawfulWire T, IsLawfulPlug T

/-! ### Symmetric monoidal coherence -/

/--
`IsMonoidal T` extends `IsLawful T` and `HasUnit T` with the symmetric
monoidal coherence laws for `par`: associativity, commutativity (braiding),
and left/right unit laws up to boundary equivalence.

Pentagon and hexagon coherence conditions are deferred: they are derivable
in the free models and hold trivially for the concrete model up to process
isomorphism.
-/
class IsMonoidal (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u})
    extends IsLawful T, HasUnit T where
  par_assoc :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Δ₂ Δ₃ : PortBoundary}
      (W₁ : T.Obj Δ₁) (W₂ : T.Obj Δ₂) (W₃ : T.Obj Δ₃),
      T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorAssoc Δ₁ Δ₂ Δ₃).toHom
        (T.par (T.par W₁ W₂) W₃) =
      T.par W₁ (T.par W₂ W₃)
  par_comm :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Δ₂ : PortBoundary} (W₁ : T.Obj Δ₁) (W₂ : T.Obj Δ₂),
      T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorComm Δ₁ Δ₂).toHom
        (T.par W₁ W₂) =
      T.par W₂ W₁
  par_leftUnit :
    ∀ {Δ : PortBoundary} (W : T.Obj Δ),
      T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorEmptyLeft Δ).toHom
        (T.par (HasUnit.unit (T := T)) W) = W
  par_rightUnit :
    ∀ {Δ : PortBoundary} (W : T.Obj Δ),
      T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorEmptyRight Δ).toHom
        (T.par W (HasUnit.unit (T := T))) = W

/-! ### Trace algebra (Joyal-Street-Verity traced symmetric monoidal) -/

/--
`IsTraced T` extends `IsMonoidal T` with the three trace axioms of a
Joyal-Street-Verity traced symmetric monoidal category, formulated for the
binary `wire` operator: wire associativity (vanishing II), wire-par
superposition, and wire commutativity (yanking via the symmetry).

These axioms make sense without `HasIdWire` or any snake equation: they are
purely about the algebra of `wire` itself and how it interacts with `par`.
A model satisfies `IsTraced` exactly when its `wire` operation behaves like
a JSV trace; the existence of duals (i.e., compact closure) is a separate
class layered on top.
-/
class IsTraced (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u})
    extends IsMonoidal T where
  /-- Wire associativity: sequential wiring can be reassociated.

  Wiring `W₁` with `W₂` through `Γ₁` and then with `W₃` through `Γ₂`
  equals wiring `W₂` with `W₃` through `Γ₂` first, then with `W₁`
  through `Γ₁`. -/
  wire_assoc :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Γ₁ Γ₂ Δ₃ : PortBoundary}
      (W₁ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor Δ₁ Γ₁))
      (W₂ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor (PortBoundary.swap Γ₁) Γ₂))
      (W₃ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor (PortBoundary.swap Γ₂) Δ₃)),
      T.wire (T.wire W₁ W₂) W₃ = T.wire W₁ (T.wire W₂ W₃)
  /-- Wire-par superposition (left): if the left factor of a parallel
  composition does not share a boundary with the second wire argument,
  it can be factored out of the wire. -/
  wire_par_superpose :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Δ₂ Γ Δ₃ : PortBoundary}
      (W₁ : T.Obj Δ₁)
      (W₂ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor Δ₂ Γ))
      (W₃ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor (PortBoundary.swap Γ) Δ₃)),
      T.wire
        (T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorAssoc Δ₁ Δ₂ Γ).symm.toHom
          (T.par W₁ W₂))
        W₃ =
      T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorAssoc Δ₁ Δ₂ Δ₃).symm.toHom
        (T.par W₁ (T.wire W₂ W₃))
  /-- Wire commutativity: the roles of the two wire factors are
  interchangeable up to boundary reshaping. -/
  wire_comm :
    ∀ {Δ₁ Γ Δ₂ : PortBoundary}
      (W₁ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor Δ₁ Γ))
      (W₂ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor (PortBoundary.swap Γ) Δ₂)),
      T.wire W₁ W₂ =
        T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorComm Δ₂ Δ₁).toHom
          (T.wire
            (T.map
              (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorComm (PortBoundary.swap Γ) Δ₂).toHom
              W₂)
            (T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorComm Δ₁ Γ).toHom W₁))

/-! ### Compact closure (snake / zig-zag identities) -/

/--
`IsCompactClosed T` extends `IsTraced T` and `HasIdWire T` with the snake
(zig-zag) identities relating the coevaluation `idWire` to `wire`, plus the
identification `unit_eq` of the monoidal unit with the trivial coevaluation.

These laws say that `swap Γ` is a categorical dual of `Γ`, witnessed by
`idWire Γ` as the coevaluation. In our setting the trace algebra and the
duality structure are independent (since `wire` is a primitive, not derived
from η/ε), so `IsCompactClosed` extends `IsTraced` rather than living
side-by-side with it: a model that satisfies `IsCompactClosed` also has a
JSV trace.
-/
class IsCompactClosed (T : _root_.Interaction.UC.OpenTheory.{u})
    extends IsTraced T, HasIdWire T where
  /-- Left zig-zag: wiring the identity wire on the left is a no-op. -/
  wire_idWire :

  /-- Right zig-zag: wiring the identity wire on the right is a no-op. -/
  wire_idWire_right :
    ∀ (Γ : PortBoundary) {Δ₁ : PortBoundary}
      (W₁ : T.Obj (PortBoundary.tensor Δ₁ Γ)),
      T.wire W₁ (HasIdWire.idWire (T := T) Γ) = W₁
  /-- The monoidal unit is the coevaluation at the trivial boundary. -/
  unit_eq :
    HasUnit.unit (T := T) =
      T.map (PortBoundary.Equiv.tensorEmptyLeft PortBoundary.empty).toHom
        (HasIdWire.idWire (T := T) PortBoundary.empty)

/-! ### Plug-wire factorization -/

/--
`HasPlugWireFactor T` extends `IsCompactClosed T` with the three laws
identifying `plug` as a derived operation: `plug` factors through `wire`
via the unit (`plug_eq_wire`), and closure of a parallel or wired composite
factors through closure of one component (`plug_par_left`/`plug_wire_left`).

This is the "everything bundle" used by downstream UC composition theorems:
`[HasPlugWireFactor T]` automatically supplies all of `IsCompactClosed T`,
`IsTraced T`, `IsMonoidal T`, `IsLawful T`, `HasUnit T`, and `HasIdWire T`
through the inheritance chain.
-/

  /-- Plug-par factorization (left): plugging a parallel composition against
  a context factors into wiring the right component into the context, then
  plugging the left component against the result.

  contractions, first over `Δ₂` and then over `Δ₁`. -/

Partial wiring is natural with respect to boundary equivalences on the still
exposed outer boundaries.

As in `map_wire`, the shared middle boundary is held fixed in this first law
layer. The point is that canonical reassociation or symmetry on the outer
interfaces can already be pushed through `wire` without enlarging the
primitive kernel of `OpenTheory`.

/--
Plugging is natural with respect to boundary equivalence.

This is the boundary-equivalence form of `map_plug`: if the exposed side of
the open system is reshaped by a canonical directed isomorphism, the same
forward boundary adaptation can be pushed across the plug after swapping
directions.

The right-hand side is phrased with the swapped boundary `Hom` directly rather
than wrapping it back into `mapEquiv`. That is intentional: once directions
are reversed, the variance becomes clearer at the raw boundary-map level than
through a second equivalence wrapper.
