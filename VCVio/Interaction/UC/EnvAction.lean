# Environment-driven action alphabets

This file introduces `EnvAction Event X`, a standalone alphabet of
environment-driven events that may act on a per-step state of type `X`.
The alphabet `Event` is the user-supplied event set (typically a sum
type with one constructor per environment event: `compromise`,
`refresh`, `setEpochParam`, etc.); the `react` function specifies how
the state evolves on each event.

This vocabulary is the foundation for CJSV22-style adaptive momentary
corruption (Canetti, Jain, Swanberg, Varia, *Universally Composable
End-to-End Secure Messaging*, CRYPTO 2022 §3.2). In CJSV22 the
environment is the privileged source of `Corrupt`-type events, distinct
from the adversary boundary (which carries port traffic). `EnvAction`
gives the same separation a typed home in VCVio: corruption events flow
through `EnvAction`, port traffic flows through `BoundaryAction`, and
the two channels are kept structurally orthogonal.

The alphabet parameter is named `Event` rather than the CJSV22-style
`Σ` because `Σ` is a reserved Lean keyword (sigma types). The CSP /
π-calculus convention "events" is also a more literal description of
what the alphabet contains than the bare letter `Σ`.

## Additive design

`EnvAction` is intentionally **standalone**: it is *not* threaded into
`OpenNodeSemantics` in this slice. Existing `OpenProcess Party Δ`
constructions are unaffected, and protocols that do not need
environment-driven events incur zero cost. A subsequent slice will
build a corruption-aware wrapper that pairs an `OpenProcess` with a
state-indexed `EnvAction`; the four `*.corrupt` forwarding lemmas
(CJSV22 §4.2) live on that wrapper.

## Probabilistic reactions

`react` is `ProbComp`-valued, so corruption-driven state transitions
can themselves be probabilistic (e.g. simulator-controlled
randomization on `compromise`). Deterministic events use
`pure ∘ update` and pay no extra cost.

The state type `X` is constrained to `Type 0` because `ProbComp : Type → Type`
lives in `Type`. This matches the universe convention in
`VCVio/Interaction/UC/Runtime.lean`, where the runtime layer requires move
and state types to live in `Type 0` for the same reason.

`EnvAction Event X` is the per-event reaction of a per-step state
`x : X` to environment events drawn from the alphabet `Event`.

`react : Event → X → ProbComp X` specifies how each event transforms
the state. The default `react` is `fun _ x => pure x` (every event is
a no-op), which keeps the empty alphabet `Event := Empty` trivially
satisfiable.

Two concrete instantiations matter here:

* `EnvAction Empty X` — the trivial alphabet, used by every protocol
  that doesn't participate in environment-driven corruption. Costs
  nothing; the canonical inhabitant is `EnvAction.empty`.
* `EnvAction (CorruptionAlphabet Sid Pid) (CorruptionState Sid Pid)` —
  the canonical CJSV22 instantiation. See
  `VCVio.Interaction.UC.Corruption` for the alphabet and state
  definitions.

The structure is independent of the boundary `Δ` so that environment
events are *not* keyed by port: an environment event acts on whatever
`X`-typed slice of state the protocol exposes, with no dependence on
which ports happen to be in scope.

The trivial environment-action over the empty alphabet: no events
ever fire.

Useful as the default for processes that do not care about
environment-driven dynamics.

def empty (X : Type) : EnvAction Empty X where
  react e _ := e.elim

/--
The constant environment-action: every event leaves the state
unchanged.

This is the canonical "passive observer" reaction, useful when a
process participates in an alphabet (so its `EnvAction` slot is
non-trivially typed) but its state has no per-event update.

def passive (Event : Type u) (X : Type) : EnvAction Event X where
  react _ x := pure x

/--
Adapt the alphabet of an environment-action along a function
`g : Event → Event'`.

The new alphabet is `Event`; an event `s : Event` is reacted to by
routing it through `g` to obtain `s' : Event'` and applying the
original reaction. This is the contravariant action on the alphabet
that lets coarser alphabets be embedded into finer ones.

def comap {Event Event' : Type u} {X : Type}
    (g : Event → Event') (e : EnvAction Event' X) : EnvAction Event X where
  react s x := e.react (g s) x

/--
Adapt the state of an environment-action along a state-projection.

Given `e : EnvAction Event X` and a projection `π : Y → X` together
with a re-installation `ι : X → Y → Y` that re-installs the updated
`X` slice into a larger state `Y`, the lifted action operates on `Y`
by reacting on the `X`-slice and re-installing the result.

This is the structural lift used when corruption-aware reactions need
to thread through richer per-step states; the `Corruption` layer uses
it to lift the canonical `CorruptionState.react` over state-bundled
`MachineProcess`es.
