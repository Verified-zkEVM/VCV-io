# Interaction specifications and transcripts

A `Spec` is a tree that describes the *shape* of a sequential interaction:
what types of moves can be exchanged at each round, and how later rounds
may depend on earlier moves. A `Transcript` records one complete play
through a `Spec` — a concrete move at every node from root to leaf.

On its own, a `Spec` says nothing about *who* makes each move or *how*
moves are computed. Those concerns are separated into companion modules:

* `Node` — realized node contexts and telescope-style node schemas
* `Decoration` — concrete per-node metadata on a fixed protocol tree
* `SyntaxOver` / `InteractionOver` — generic local syntax and local execution
  laws over realized node contexts
* `ShapeOver` — the functorial refinement of syntax, used when recursive
  continuations admit a generic map
* `Strategy` — one-player strategies with monadic effects
* `Append`, `Replicate`, `Chain` — sequential composition and iteration

This is the foundation of the entire `Interaction` layer, which replaces
the old flat `ProtocolSpec n` model with a dependent-type-native design.
The key advantage is that later rounds can depend on earlier moves, which
is mathematically forced in protocols like sumcheck and FRI.

## Polynomial substrate

`Spec` is built directly on top of the polynomial-functor library in
`ToMathlib/PFunctor`:

```
Spec := PFunctor.FreeM Spec.basePFunctor PUnit
```

where `Spec.basePFunctor : PFunctor.{u+1, u}` has positions `Type u`
(every node carries a move type) and a child family given by the identity
(continuations are indexed by moves). This is the polynomial that
generates the *unindexed shape* of an interaction tree; payload-bearing
shapes are obtained by replacing `PFunctor.FreeM` with the corresponding
`PFunctor.FreeM ... α` for nontrivial `α` (see `Strategy` / `StepOver`).

The `Spec` notation, `Spec.done`, and `Spec.node` are tagged with
`@[match_pattern]` so that downstream definitions and proofs continue to
pattern-match exactly as before, with no rewrite required at call sites.
The substrate is the truth; the names are an ergonomic re-skin in the
spirit of `OracleSpec`/`OracleComp`.

## Module map

- `Basic/` — spec, node contexts, decoration, generic shapes, strategy,
  composition (this layer)
- `Concurrent/` — structural concurrent source syntax, frontiers and residuals,
  typed interfaces and directed open boundaries,
  operations-first open-composition theory and its first final-tagless free
  lawful model,
  structural frontier traces and true-concurrency refinements, dynamic
  `Process` / `Machine` / `Tree` frontends, generic process executions and
  policies, finite prefixes and infinite runs, observation extraction,
  refinement, bisimulation, packaged equivalence notions, fairness, liveness,
  per-party observation profiles,
  scheduler/control ownership, and current local frontier views
- `TwoParty/` — sender/receiver roles, `withRoles`, `Counterpart`
- `Reduction.lean` — prover, verifier, reduction
- `Oracle/` — oracle decoration, path-dependent oracle access
- `Security.lean` / `OracleSecurity.lean` — security definitions
- `Boundary/` — same-transcript interface adaptation
- `Multiparty/` — native multiparty local views and per-party profiles,
  including broadcast and directed communication models

namespace Interaction

namespace Spec

/-- The polynomial functor that generates the shape of an interaction
spec: positions are move types `Type u`, and the child family at a
position `M : Type u` is `M` itself (one continuation per move).

This is the canonical representation of "an interactive node where the
participant chooses a value of some move type, and the continuation is
selected by that value". It is independent of payload data, controller
attribution, and execution semantics; those layers refine the same
polynomial via `Decoration`, `NodeProfile`, and `StepOver`. -/

def basePFunctor : PFunctor.{u+1, u} where
  A := Type u
  B := id

end Spec

/-- A `Spec` describes the shape of a sequential interaction as a tree.
Each internal node specifies a move space `Moves`, and the rest of the
protocol may depend on the chosen move `x : Moves`.

On its own, a `Spec` is intentionally minimal:
it records only the branching structure of the interaction.
It does **not** say
* who controls a node,
* what local data is attached to that node,
* what kind of participant object lives there, or
* how a collection of participants executes the node.

Those additional layers are supplied separately by:
* `Spec.Node.Context` / `Spec.Node.Schema`, for node-local semantic contexts
  and their telescope-style descriptions;
* `Spec.Decoration`, for concrete nodewise metadata;
* `Spec.SyntaxOver`, for the most general local participant syntax over
  realized node contexts;
* `Spec.ShapeOver`, for the functorial refinement of such syntax;
* `Spec.InteractionOver`, for local execution laws over such syntax.

`Spec` is **definitionally** the free monad on `Spec.basePFunctor` at the
unit payload, exposing the polynomial substrate that the rest of the
`Interaction` library builds on. The `Spec.done` / `Spec.node` aliases
are tagged with `@[match_pattern]`, so existing pattern-matching code
continues to work unchanged. -/
