# Per-node monad decorations

`MonadDecoration spec` assigns a `BundledMonad` to each internal node.

The corresponding one-participant syntax, `Strategy.monadicSyntax`, chooses a
move at a node and places the continuation in the monad recorded by that node.
Use it directly with `StrategyOver` for whole-tree strategies and with
`InteractionOver.run` through `Strategy.monadicInteraction` for execution in an
ambient monad.

/--
Constant monad decoration: every node in the interaction tree uses the same
bundled monad.

This is the bridge between ordinary single-monad strategies and strategies
whose node effects are described by a `MonadDecoration`.

/--
Nodewise monad homomorphism between two monad decorations on the same
interaction tree.

At each internal node it gives a lift from the source bundled monad to the
target bundled monad, together with recursive lifts for every continuation
subtree.

decorated node monad into the ambient execution monad before the generic runner
continues with the selected subtree. -/
