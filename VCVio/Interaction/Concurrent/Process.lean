# Dynamic concurrent processes

This file introduces the semantic center of the concurrent `Interaction`
layer.

The structural syntax in `Concurrent.Spec` is a useful source language, but it
is not the only natural presentation of concurrency. Many systems are better
viewed as a **residual process** which, at any moment, exposes one finite
sequential interaction episode; completing that episode yields the next
residual process.

That is the viewpoint formalized here.

The file is organized in two levels:

* `StepOver Γ P` and `ProcessOver Γ` are the generic forms, parameterized by a
  realized node context `Γ`;
* `Step Party P` and `Process Party` are the closed-world specializations whose
  node metadata is exactly `NodeProfile Party`, the bundled
  `NodeAuthority + NodeView` view of node-local semantic data.

So the intended reading is:

* a **step** is one finite local protocol episode,
* a **process** is an unbounded sequence of such steps obtained by
  continuation,
* and controller / observation metadata lives in a node context rather than
  being built into the process infrastructure itself.

This design stays continuation-first, but is more general than the structural
tree frontend: cyclic or unbounded behavior is represented by the residual
state type, while each individual step remains a finite `Interaction.Spec`.

`NodeAuthority Party X` records the controller-attribution part of node-local
semantic data: which parties are credited as controllers of each move
`x : X`.

This is one of the two orthogonal layers of `NodeProfile`. It is stored
separately so that downstream reasoning that depends only on
controller attribution (corruption policies, scheduler accountability,
party-side responsibility arguments) can take a `NodeAuthority` parameter
without committing to any particular observation structure.
-/
structure NodeAuthority (Party : Type u) (X : Type w) where
  controllers : X → List Party := fun _ => []

/--
`NodeView Party X` records the view-attribution part of node-local
semantic data: what each party `me : Party` locally observes of the
chosen move `x : X`, expressed as a `Multiparty.ViewMode X`.

This is the second of the two orthogonal layers of `NodeProfile`. It
is stored separately so that downstream reasoning that depends only on
local views (information-flow arguments, projection / trace semantics,
view-equivalence proofs) can take a `NodeView` parameter without
committing to any particular controller attribution.

The name avoids confusion with `Multiparty.Observation X`, which is the
unrelated **per-move information-lattice kernel** living in
`Multiparty/Observation.lean`. `NodeView` is the per-party operational
view assignment at one node; `Observation` is one quotient morphism
`X → Obs` packaged with its codomain.
-/
structure NodeView (Party : Type u) (X : Type w) where
  views : Party → Multiparty.ViewMode X

/--
`NodeProfile Party X` records the local semantic data attached to one
sequential interaction node whose move space is `X`.

It bundles two orthogonal layers:

* `NodeAuthority Party X` — `controllers x` is the controller-path contribution
  associated to choosing the move `x : X`;
* `NodeView Party X` — `views me` assigns to party `me` its local view
  of the chosen move.

The two layers are intentionally stored as separate factor structures.
Many natural systems align them so that the first controller in
`controllers x` has local view `.active`, but this file does not force that
relationship definitionally; any desired coherence law can be imposed later
as a separate well-formedness predicate.

Because `NodeProfile` `extends` both factors, the dot-notation accessors
`node.controllers`, `node.views` and the structure-literal constructor
`{ controllers := ..., views := ... }` work exactly as if the fields were
declared inline. The factor projections `node.toNodeAuthority`,
`node.toNodeView` are auto-generated and let downstream code restrict
attention to a single layer.
-/
structure NodeProfile (Party : Type u) (X : Type w)
    extends NodeAuthority Party X, NodeView Party X

/--
The closed-world node context used by the current concurrent semantics.

At a node with move space `X`, the context value is exactly the
`NodeProfile Party X` describing:

* which parties are recorded as controllers of the chosen move, and
* what each party locally observes of that move.

This is the context whose specialization recovers the existing closed-world
`Step` / `Process` APIs.
-/
abbrev StepContext (Party : Type u) := fun X => NodeProfile Party X

/--
`StepOver Γ P` is one finite sequential interaction episode whose nodes are
decorated by realized context `Γ`, and whose completion produces the next
residual process state `P`.

Fields:

* `spec` is the shape of the sequential interaction episode;
* `semantics` decorates that sequential tree by node-local context `Γ`;
* `next` maps a complete transcript of that episode to the next residual
  process state.

The important point is that a `StepOver` is **not** restricted to a single
atomic event. One concurrent step may itself be a short sequential protocol:
for example, a scheduler choice followed by a payload choice, or a small
request/response exchange treated as one logical concurrent transition.

So `StepOver` is the right object when the concurrency layer should expose
finite sequential structure inside each global step, rather than flattening
everything into atomic transitions.

## Polynomial reading

`StepOver Γ P` is the application to `P` of the polynomial functor
`StepOver.toPFunctor Γ` whose positions are `Γ`-decorated specs and whose
directions over a position are transcripts of its underlying spec. The
`Equiv` `StepOver.equivObj` exhibits this on the nose by regrouping the
`(spec, semantics, next)` fields. The position type is itself equivalent to
`Interaction.Spec.DecoratedSpec Γ` via `Interaction.Spec.decoratedSpecEquiv`,
identifying `StepOver` as a polynomial substrate built directly on top of
`Γ.toPFunctor`. The structure form is preserved as the working API because
its named fields support clean `{ spec := ..., semantics := ..., next := ... }`
construction at every call site, and projections such as `(mapContext f s).spec`
are definitionally equal to `s.spec`.

/-! ### Polynomial bridge

`StepOver Γ P` is the application to `P` of the polynomial functor
`StepOver.toPFunctor Γ` whose positions are `Γ`-decorated specs and whose
direction family at each position is the type of complete transcripts of
the underlying spec. The `Equiv` `StepOver.equivObj` regroups the
`(spec, semantics, next)` fields into the polynomial form
`(position, continuation)`; both roundtrips are definitionally `rfl`.

The position type `Σ spec, Decoration Γ spec` is itself equivalent to
`Interaction.Spec.DecoratedSpec Γ` via `Interaction.Spec.decoratedSpecEquiv`,
which is the free monad on `Γ.toPFunctor` at the unit payload. This bridge
identifies `StepOver` as a polynomial substrate sitting directly on top of
`Γ.toPFunctor` while preserving the structure form's ergonomic call sites
and definitional projection equalities. -/

/-- The polynomial functor whose application to `P` is `StepOver Γ P`.

A position is a `Γ`-decorated spec — a pair of an interaction shape
`spec : Spec` and a `Decoration Γ spec` of per-node `Γ`-metadata on it.
A direction over such a position is a complete transcript of `spec`.

Up to `Interaction.Spec.decoratedSpecEquiv`, positions are exactly
`Interaction.Spec.DecoratedSpec Γ`, the free term of `Γ.toPFunctor` at the
unit payload. -/

  B := fun p => Interaction.Spec.Transcript p.1

/-- `StepOver Γ P` is exactly `(StepOver.toPFunctor Γ).Obj P`, exhibiting
the step-over structure as a polynomial application.

The forward direction regroups the `(spec, semantics, next)` fields into
the polynomial form `(position, continuation)`, and the inverse unpacks
them again. Both roundtrips are definitionally `rfl`. -/

/-- The position type of `StepOver.toPFunctor Γ` is the same data as a

/--
`ProcessOver Γ` is a continuation-based concurrent process whose current step
episodes are decorated by realized context `Γ`.

From any residual process state `p : Proc`, the process exposes exactly one
step protocol `step p : StepOver Γ Proc`. Running that step to completion
produces the next residual state.

So `ProcessOver` should be read as:

> a system whose behavior unfolds as a sequence of finite step protocols.

This is the generic semantic center for the concurrent layer. Structural
trees, flat machines, and future frontends can all compile into `ProcessOver`
by choosing an appropriate node-local context `Γ`.

/--
Binary-choice interleaving of two processes with different node contexts.

Given processes `p₁` over `Γ₁` and `p₂` over `Γ₂`, context morphisms mapping
each into a common target context `Δ`, and a scheduler decoration in `Δ` for
the `ULift Bool` choice node, produce a single `ProcessOver Δ` whose state
space is `p₁.Proc × p₂.Proc`.

At each step, a scheduler node chooses left (`true`) or right (`false`), then
the selected subprocess's step protocol runs with its decoration mapped into
`Δ`. Only the selected component of the product state advances.

/-! ### Polynomial-coalgebra behavior

`StepOver.toPFunctor Γ` (from S3) exhibits one episode of `Γ`-decorated
interaction as a polynomial functor. Its terminal coalgebra is the M-type
`PFunctor.M (StepOver.toPFunctor Γ)`: the type of all possibly-infinite
trees of step protocols.

Every `ProcessOver Γ` is canonically a coalgebra for this polynomial
functor (`process.step` composed with the polynomial bridge `equivObj`),
so the universal property of M-types gives a unique coalgebra
homomorphism `behavior : process.Proc → M (StepOver.toPFunctor Γ)`. This
function records, at each residual state, the observable infinite tree
of step protocols obtained by repeatedly running `process.step`.

The universal property is concretely the "bisimulation by uniqueness"
principle: any candidate behavior function that respects the coalgebra
structure must equal the canonical one. Equality of behavior trees is
therefore the canonical observational equivalence on residual states,
agreeing on the nose with any relational bisimulation witness one might
construct via `Concurrent.Refinement.Bisimulation`. -/

The closed-world specialization of `StepOver`.

Here the node context is fixed to `StepContext Party`, so every node carries
the usual controller-path and local-view data for that party universe.

`controllerPath step tr` is the controller sequence exposed by the concrete
step transcript `tr`.

Every visited node contributes the controller list recorded for the chosen
move at that node. These per-node contributions are concatenated along the
whole step transcript.

So if a step internally consists of, say, "the scheduler chooses a branch,
then Alice chooses a payload", the controller path records both pieces in
order.

`currentController? step tr` is the head of the controller path exposed by the
concrete transcript `tr`, if such a controller exists.

This is the most immediate "who controlled this step?" projection. It is only
the first controller because one step may internally contain several
controlled subchoices.

Closed-world controller-path projection for a `StepOver` specialized to
`StepContext Party`.

This bridge keeps the old dot-notation ergonomics after the `StepOver`
cutover: downstream closed-world code can still write
`(process.step p).controllerPath tr`.

`Process.System` augments a closed-world process by the standard verification
predicates used throughout VCVio and in transition-system-style frameworks.

Its parent field `toProcess` is the dynamic semantics; the remaining fields are
verification metadata on top of that semantics:

* `init` marks initial residual states;
* `assumptions` records ambient assumptions on runs;
* `safe` is the intended state safety predicate;
* `inv` is the intended inductive invariant.

This keeps the semantic object and the proof obligations separate while still
bundling them in one place for refinement and liveness statements.
