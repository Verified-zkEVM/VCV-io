# State-Separating Proofs: Hybrid arguments and the linked-game reduction

This file collects two staple SSP results, phrased at the package level:

* `Package.advantage_hybrid` — the iterated triangle inequality for an `n`-step hybrid.
  Given a sequence of games `G₀, G₁, ..., Gₙ` (with potentially different state types) and a
  single Boolean adversary `A`, the distinguishing advantage between `G₀` and `Gₙ` is bounded
  by the sum of consecutive advantages.

* `Package.advantage_link_left_eq_advantage_shiftLeft` — the advantage-level corollary of the
  program-level `run_link_eq_run_shiftLeft` (proved in `VCVio.SSP.Composition`): replacing the
  inner game in `P.link _` only shifts the adversary; the outer reduction package `P` becomes
  part of the new adversary, exactly as in SSProve.

These two ingredients together justify the standard SSP game-hopping pattern: produce a chain
of intermediate games related by `link`-ed reductions, then collapse the chain via the hybrid
inequality.

## Universe layout

`ProbComp : Type → Type` and the adversary's return type `Bool : Type` pin the intermediate
range, export range, and state to `Type 0`. The index universes `uₘ, uₑ` for the intermediate
and export specs remain *independent*, matching `VCVio.SSP.Advantage`.

The raw program-level `shiftLeft` and `run_link_eq_run_shiftLeft` retain their full universe
polymorphism over `uᵢ, uₘ, uₑ, vᵢ, v`; they live in `VCVio.SSP.Composition`. Only ranges and
state are pinned to `Type 0` here, because `advantage` is already so pinned. -/

section Hybrid

variable {ιₑ : Type uₑ} {E : OracleSpec.{uₑ, 0} ιₑ}

/-- **Hybrid lemma.** For any sequence of games `G 0, G 1, ..., G n` and any single Boolean
adversary `A`, the distinguishing advantage between the endpoints is bounded by the sum of
consecutive advantages.

The state types may differ from step to step: `σ : ℕ → Type` and
`G i : Package unifSpec E (σ i)`. This is just the iterated `boolDistAdvantage` triangle
inequality, packaged for SSP-style game-hopping proofs. -/

  {σ₁ : Type}

/-- **SSP reduction (advantage form).** With the same outer reduction package
`P : Package M E σ₁` linked to two candidate inner games `Q₀, Q₁` exporting `M`, the
distinguishing advantage between the linked games equals the advantage between the inner
games against the *shifted adversary* `P.shiftLeft A`. The outer reduction package `P` is
absorbed into the adversary. -/
