# Lemmas About the Distribution Semantics of Seq

This file collects various lemmas about the monadic sequence operation `og <*> oa`.

One especially important case is `f <$> oa <*> ob` where `f : α → β → γ`,
that runs the two computations `oa` and `ob` to get some `x` and `y` respectively,
returning only the value `f x y`.
