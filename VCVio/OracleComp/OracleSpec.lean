# Specifications of Available Oracles

This file defines a type `OracleSpec` to represent a set of available oracles.
The available oracles are all indexed by some (potentially infinite) indexing set `ι`,
and for each index `i` a pair of types `domain i` and `range i`.

TODO: update documentation (now there is a single dependent oracle)

We also define a number of basic oracle constructions:
* `T →ₒ U`: Access to a single oracle with given input and output
* `coinSpec`: A single oracle for flipping a coin
* `unifSpec`: A family of oracles for selecting from `[0..n]` for any `n`

/-- Oracles are specified by a polynomial functor, where `A` is the index/input of the oracle,
and `B` gives the output type of the oracle for a given index.
dt: should we actually have this as an alias? Could in theory drop it completely. -/
abbrev OracleSpec := PFunctor

example : Inhabited OracleSpec := inferInstance --As (Inhabited (PFunctor))

abbrev OracleSpec.domain (spec : OracleSpec) : Type _ := spec.A

/-- Type of the range for calls to the oracle corresponding to index `i`. -/
abbrev OracleSpec.range (spec : OracleSpec) (i : spec.A) := spec.B i

/-- An oracle spec has indexing in a type `ι` if the `range` function factors through `ι`.
dtumad: not sure if this is really the right approach for e.g. `pregen`. -/

weaker than `unifSpec`, as we have only finitely many coin flips. -/

By adding `1` to the index we avoid selection from the empty type `Fin 0 ≃ empty`.-/

One question is that we may have empty selection
Select uniformly from a range (not starting from zero).-/
