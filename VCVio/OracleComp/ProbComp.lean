# Computations with Uniform Selection Oracles

This file defines a type `ProbComp α` for the case of `OracleComp` with access to a
uniform selection oracle, specified by `unifSpec`, as well as common operations for this type.

We define `$[0..n]` as uniform selection starting from zero for any `n : ℕ` (`uniformFin`)
as well as a version `$[n⋯m]` that tries to synthesize an instance of `n < m` (`uniformRange`).
This allows us to avoid needing an `OptionT` wrapper to handle empty ranges.

We also define typeclasses `HasUniformSelect β cont` and `HasUniformSelect! β cont` to allow for
`$ xs` and `$! xs` notation for uniform sampling from a container.
These don't really enforce any semantics, so any new definition will need to prove
lemmas about the behavior of the operation.
TODO: we could introduce a mixin typeclass at least to handle this?

`SampleableType α` on the other hand allows for `$ᵗ α` notation for uniform type sampleing,
and *does* enforce the uniformity of outputs.
Encapsulating the thing you want to select in a `SampleableType` can therefore give more
useful lemmas out of the box, in particular when using subtypes.

TODO: Some lemmas here don't exist at the `PMF`/`SPMF` levels.
