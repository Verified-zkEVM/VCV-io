# Phase 1: backward-rule application for `@[lspec_spike]` (spike)

**Status: experimental spike. Not exported via `VCVio.lean`.**

This file is Phase 1 of the migration plan tracked in issue #351.
It builds the smallest piece of machinery on top of
`UnifiedLSpec.lean` that lets a goal in `⊑`-form be **closed** (or
reduced to subgoals) by an entry returned from `lookup`:

* `bridgeToLeForm`: instantiate an `LSpecEntry`'s proof with fresh
  metavars and bridge `Triple → ⊑ wp`.  `RelTriple` is a `def` and
  unfolds definitionally, so it needs no explicit rewrite.

* `tryApply`: feed the bridged proof into `Meta.apply` against a goal
  metavariable.  Returns `none` if the entry does not apply, otherwise
  the list of remaining subgoals (typically `[]` for our demo lemmas).

* `tryApplyMatching`: glue together `lookup` and `tryApply`: take a
  goal in `⊑`-form, classify it (unary or relational), look up
  matching entries from the unified registry, and apply the first one
  that succeeds.  Mirrors how `vcstep`/`rvcstep` would consume the new
  registry side-by-side with the legacy `@[vcspec]` chain.

## Scope of Phase 1

What this layer covers:

* Lemmas whose `pre`, `post`, and `epost` are abstract (forall-bound),
  e.g. `triple_pure : Triple (post x) (pure x) post`.  Specialisation
  happens through ordinary unification inside `Meta.apply`.

* Goals whose `post` and `epost` slots match a registered lemma after
  beta/eta reduction (Lean's `isDefEq` handles those routinely).

What it intentionally does **not** cover:

* Consequence weakening when the lemma's `post` or `epost` is
  *concrete* but the goal's is different.  Loom2's
  `mkSpecBackwardProof` (`Loom/Tactic/Spec.lean:143-258`) handles this
  by abstracting `post`/`epost` to fresh mvars and chaining
  `WP.wp_consequence_rel` / `WP.wp_econs_rel`; doing the same here is
  the natural extension once Phase 2 (side-by-side mode in
  `vcstep`/`rvcstep`) needs it.

* Excess-state args (e.g. `Pred = σ → Prop`).  Our quantitative
  carriers are flat (`ℝ≥0∞`, `Prob`), so no state binders are
  required for the spike.

* Caching.  `tryApply` rebuilds the bridged proof on every call.  Adding
  a `Std.HashMap (Name × Expr) BackwardRule` cache, modeled on
  Loom2's `mkBackwardRuleFromSpecCached`, is mechanical follow-up.

The goal of Phase 1 is to demonstrate end-to-end usefulness of the
unified registry, not to ship a production tactic.  See
`UnifiedLSpecBackwardDemo.lean` for the worked example.

/-! ## Bridging to `⊑`-form -/

/--
If `(prf, type)` represents a proof of `Std.Do'.Triple pre x post epost`,
return the `⊑`-form `prf' : pre ⊑ wp x post epost` and its type.
Otherwise return the input unchanged.

This mirrors Loom2's `Loom.Tactic.SpecAttr.tripleToWpProof?` (see
`loom2/Loom/Tactic/Attr.lean:52-66`).  We need to manually reorder
the type-class arguments because `Std.Do'.Triple` and
`Std.Do'.Triple.iff` quantify them in different positions:

* `Triple` order:    `m Pred EPred α Monad AL EAL WP pre x post epost`
* `Triple.iff` order: `m Pred EPred Monad AL EAL WP α x pre post epost`

(`Triple.iff` is defined inside `namespace Triple` in
`loom2/Loom/Triple/Basic.lean:47-49`, after a `variable` declaration
that fixes `m Pred EPred`.  The `α` migrates to a section-local
implicit and ends up after the instances.)

Instantiate an `LSpecEntry`'s proof and (if needed) bridge to
`pre ⊑ wp …` form.

For unary entries whose lemma is stated as `Triple …`, this calls
`Triple.iff.mp` so the resulting proof has type `pre ⊑ wp x post epost`.
For relational entries whose lemma is already in `pre ⊑ rwp …` form
(e.g. `rwp_pure`), no rewriting is needed; `RelTriple` itself is a
`def` and unfolds definitionally during `Meta.apply`'s `isDefEq`.

Returns `(proof, type, postMVars)` where `postMVars` is the array of
metavariables introduced for the lemma's universally quantified
parameters (currently unused by the apply path; kept so that future
versions can post-filter on `WP`/`RelWP` instance metavariables).

    MetaM (Expr × Expr × Array Expr) := do
  let (xs, _bs, prf, type) ← entry.proof.instantiate

  return (prf', type', xs)

/-! ## Applying an entry to a goal -/

/--
For lemmas whose `Pred` is universe-polymorphic (e.g.
`rwp_pure : post a b ⊑ rwp (pure a) (pure b) post epost₁ epost₂`),
`Lean.Order.PartialOrder.rel` cannot reduce to `≤` until `Pred` is
fixed.  But the goal `0 ≤ rwp …` uses raw `≤`, so `Meta.apply` reaches
a dead end (it cannot unify `rel ?Pred …` with `≤ ENNReal …` without
already knowing `?Pred = ENNReal`).

We unblock this by inspecting the goal: if the goal head is `≤` at
some concrete `Pred`, we eagerly unify the bridged proof's `Pred`
slot with that type before handing off to `Meta.apply`.

This mirrors what Loom2's `BackwardRule.apply` does indirectly via
`Sym.Pattern.unify?` (which carries the lattice type as a pattern
key and unifies it eagerly).
-/
private def fixPredFromGoal? (prfTy goalTy : Expr) : MetaM Unit := do
  -- Bridged proof type: `Lean.Order.PartialOrder.rel (Pred := ?P) ?pre ?rhs`
  let prfTy ← whnfR prfTy
  let goalTy ← whnfR goalTy
  unless prfTy.isAppOfArity ``Lean.Order.PartialOrder.rel 4 do return
  -- Goal: `LE.le (α := P) ?pre ?rhs` (P is the ambient type of the precondition)
  unless goalTy.isAppOfArity ``LE.le 4 do return
  let prfPred  := prfTy.getArg! 0
  let goalPred := goalTy.getArg! 0
  -- Best-effort: if either side is still a metavariable, unify; ignore failure.

Try to apply `entry` to the goal `mvarId`, which is expected to be in
`⊑`-form (`pre ⊑ wp …` or `pre ⊑ rwp …`, equivalently `≤` in our
quantitative carriers).

Returns `some subgoals` on success, `none` if the entry does not
unify or `Meta.apply` raises an exception.  No subgoals reasonably
remain for `triple_pure` and `rwp_pure` against fully-concrete goals,
which is what the demo file checks.

/--
End-to-end backward chaining: classify the goal, look up matching
entries from the unified registry, and apply the first one that
succeeds.  Returns the chosen entry plus any remaining subgoals.

This is the single function that a future `vcstep`-style tactic would
call once per step.  It is intentionally side-effect-free with respect
to the legacy `@[vcspec]` registries; Phase 2 of the migration plan
(issue #351) will wire it in side-by-side.
