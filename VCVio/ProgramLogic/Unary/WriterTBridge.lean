# `Std.Do` weakest-precondition bridge for `WriterT`

Provides `Std.Do.WP` and `Std.Do.WPMonad` instances for `WriterT ω m`,
together with `@[spec]` lemmas for `MonadWriter.tell`,
`MonadLift.monadLift`, and `WriterT.run`. With these in scope, `mvcgen`
can walk through any `do`-block in `WriterT ω m`, treating the writer
log `ω` as a state component (post-shape `(.arg ω ps)` where `ps` is the
inner monad's post-shape).

The bridge supports two parameterizations in parallel:

* `[EmptyCollection ω] [Append ω] [LawfulAppend ω]`, which is what
  `loggingOracle` (over `WriterT (QueryLog spec) (OracleComp spec)`) needs
  because `QueryLog spec` unfolds to `List _`.
* `[Monoid ω]`, which is what `countingOracle`/`costOracle` (over
  `WriterT (QueryCount ι) (OracleComp spec)`) need. `QueryCount ι` unfolds
  to `ι → ℕ`, and the effective monoid on it is the *additive* one
  repackaged as a multiplicative `Monoid` (so `1` represents the all-zero
  function and `*` represents pointwise `+`). `ι → ℕ` has no `Append`
  instance, so only the `[Monoid ω]` parameterization applies there.

The two `WP` / `WPMonad` instances live side-by-side and do not overlap on
any currently used target type (`List _` has no `Monoid` instance;
`ι → ℕ` has no `Append` instance). To defensively guard against future
overlap on a type carrying both `Append` and `Monoid`, the `Monoid`
variants are registered at `low` priority so the `Append` variants win
typeclass resolution whenever both apply.

## Implementation

`wp x` for `x : WriterT ω m α` is interpreted as the state-tracking
predicate transformer
```
PredTrans.pushArg (fun (s : ω) =>
  (fun z : α × ω => (z.1, s ++ z.2)) <$> wp (WriterT.run x))
```
i.e., the writer log is threaded through as state and accumulated via
`++`. The `LawfulAppend` law (`empty_append`, `append_empty`,
`append_assoc`) is what makes `wp` preserve `pure` and `bind`.

/-! ## `Monoid`-based `WP` interpretation

The dual parameterization: the writer log `ω` carries `[Monoid ω]`
(e.g. `QueryCount ι = ι → ℕ` with `1 = 0` and `* = +`). The
interpretation is the same as `wpAppend` but with `1` / `*` in place
of `∅` / `++`. The monoid laws `mul_one`, `one_mul`, `mul_assoc` play
the role of `LawfulAppend.append_empty`, `empty_append`, `append_assoc`. -/

/-- The underlying predicate-transformer interpretation of a `WriterT ω m`
computation when `ω` is a (multiplicative) monoid. Analogous to
`wpAppend` but with `*` / `1` in place of `++` / `∅`. -/

    (fun (z : α × ω) => (z.1, s * z.2)) <$> wp (WriterT.run x))

/-- `WP` instance for `WriterT ω m` under the `[Monoid ω]` parameterization.
The writer log is threaded through as state and accumulated via `*` with
identity `1`. Does not conflict with `instWPAppend` because the target
types they fire on are disjoint (`List _` has no `Monoid`, `ι → ℕ` has
no `Append`). The priority is set `low` so that, on a hypothetical `ω`
carrying *both* `Append` and `Monoid`, `instWPAppend` wins typeclass
resolution and no WP diamond arises. -/

/-! ## `wp` simp lemmas for `WriterT` operations

These rewrite `wp⟦x⟧ Q` for common `WriterT` operations (`tell`,
`monadLift`) into simpler forms involving the inner monad's `wp`. They are
analogous to `Std.Do.WP.monadLift_StateT`, etc.

Each simp lemma is provided in two parallel variants matching the two
`WP` instances for `WriterT`: the `Append`-based one (suffix `_append`,
exposed as the default under the original name for backward
compatibility) and the `Monoid`-based one (suffix `_monoid`). -/
