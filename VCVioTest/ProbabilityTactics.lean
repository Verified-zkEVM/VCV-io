# Probability tactic benchmark

A curated, deliberately broad corpus of "high-school / intro-crypto-prerequisite" facts about
**outcome probabilities, event probabilities, failure probabilities, support, and evaluation
distributions**, each discharged by a single *terminal* tactic — `simp` or `grind`. The file
**gates `simp` and `grind` as stable terminal tactics** over this surface, so a regression in
either surfaces here in isolation rather than deep inside a downstream proof.

Conventions:
* **Mirrors.** Where a fact is closed by *both* `simp` and `grind`, both are kept, so each tactic
  stays exercised on that shape. This is the bulk of the file.
* **Single tactic + target.** Where only one tactic closes a goal, that tactic is used and the gap
  is recorded with a `target(grind)` / `target(simp)` note — a concrete goal for future tactic work.
* **Only stable tactics.** No example hangs or explodes. `grind` reasons well about symbolic /
  atomic / membership / equiprobability / `pure`+`bind`-normalised goals; computing a concrete value
  or factoring a structured computation (`<*>`, a non-trivial `<$>`/`if`) is `simp`'s job, so those
  are `simp`-terminal with a `target(grind)` note.

`grind` normalises monadic structure (`bind_pure`, `pure_bind`, `bind_assoc`, `map_pure` are
`@[grind =]`), so `bind`-`pure`-shaped goals close by `grind`; `Set.Nonempty` bridges
(`probFailure_eq_one_iff_not_nonempty`, `support_uniformSample_nonempty`) keep `Pr[⊥]=1` reasoning
reachable. `ProbComp` itself never fails — interesting `Pr[⊥ | _]` lives in `OptionT ProbComp`.

/-! # 1. Outcome probability — `Pr[= x | _]` -/

/-! ## Deterministic outcomes
A `pure` computation puts all of its mass on its value. -/

example (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | (pure x : ProbComp Bool)] = 1 := by simp
example (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | (pure x : ProbComp Bool)] = 1 := by grind

example (x y : Bool) : Pr[= x | (pure y : ProbComp Bool)] = if x = y then 1 else 0 := by simp
example (x y : Bool) : Pr[= x | (pure y : ProbComp Bool)] = if x = y then 1 else 0 := by grind

example (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | (pure x : ProbComp Bool)] ≠ 0 := by simp
example (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | (pure x : ProbComp Bool)] ≠ 0 := by grind

/-! ## Uniform draws
Every outcome of a uniform draw over an `n`-element type has probability `1 / n`.

target(grind): computing a concrete value needs `Fintype.card`/`ℝ≥0∞` arithmetic `grind` does not do
(it fails fast); `simp` evaluates it. Symbolic facts (`≠ 0`, equiprobability) close by both. -/

example : Pr[= true | $ᵗ Bool] = 2⁻¹ := by simp
example : Pr[= (0 : Fin 6) | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] = 6⁻¹ := by simp

example : Pr[= true | $ᵗ Bool] ≠ 0 := by simp
example : Pr[= true | $ᵗ Bool] ≠ 0 := by grind

example (x y : Fin 6) : Pr[= x | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] = Pr[= y | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] := by simp
example (x y : Fin 6) : Pr[= x | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] = Pr[= y | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] := by grind

example : Pr[= true | $ᵗ Bool] = Pr[= false | $ᵗ Bool] := by simp
example : Pr[= true | $ᵗ Bool] = Pr[= false | $ᵗ Bool] := by grind

example : Pr[= (3 : ZMod 5) | $ᵗ (ZMod 5)] = 5⁻¹ := by simp
example : Pr[= (0 : BitVec 4) | $ᵗ (BitVec 4)] = 16⁻¹ := by simp

example : Pr[= (0 : Fin 3) | $ᵗ (Fin 3)] ≠ 0 := by grind

example (x : Bool ⊕ Bool) : Pr[= x | $ᵗ (Bool ⊕ Bool)] ≠ 0 := by grind

/-! ## Bounds
An outcome probability lies in `[0, 1]` and is never `⊤`.

target(grind): `0 ≤ _` in `ℝ≥0∞` is just `zero_le`, but `grind` routes through the support machinery
and fails; `simp` closes it. -/

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | mx] ≤ 1 := by simp
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | mx] ≤ 1 := by grind

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | mx] ≠ ⊤ := by simp
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | mx] ≠ ⊤ := by grind

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) : 0 ≤ Pr[= x | mx] := by simp

/-! ## `bind`/`pure`-normalised computations
`grind` normalises monadic structure, so a redundant `bind`/`pure` collapses and the outcome
probability matches the underlying draw. -/

example : Pr[= true | do let b ← $ᵗ Bool; pure b] = Pr[= true | $ᵗ Bool] := by simp
example : Pr[= true | do let b ← $ᵗ Bool; pure b] = Pr[= true | $ᵗ Bool] := by grind

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) :
    Pr[= x | do let y ← mx; pure y] = Pr[= x | mx] := by simp
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) :
    Pr[= x | do let y ← mx; pure y] = Pr[= x | mx] := by grind

example (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | (do let _ ← $ᵗ Bool; pure x : ProbComp Bool)] = 1 := by simp
example (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | (do let _ ← $ᵗ Bool; pure x : ProbComp Bool)] = 1 := by grind

/-! ## Independence and the multiplication rule
Two independent uniform draws factor: the joint mass is the product of the marginals.

target(grind): `grind` cannot factor an independent product — the second factor sits under a binder
(`<*>`'s thunk or `bind`'s continuation), unindexable by `grind`; `simp` factors it. -/

example (a b : Bool) :
    Pr[= (a, b) | do let x ← $ᵗ Bool; let y ← $ᵗ Bool; pure (x, y)]
      = Pr[= a | $ᵗ Bool] * Pr[= b | $ᵗ Bool] := by simp

example :
    Pr[= ((5 : Fin 6), (5 : Fin 6)) | do let x ← $ᵗ (Fin 6); let y ← $ᵗ (Fin 6); pure (x, y)]
      = 6⁻¹ * 6⁻¹ := by simp

example (z : Bool × Bool) :
    Pr[= z | (·, ·) <$> ($ᵗ Bool) <*> ($ᵗ Bool)]
      = Pr[= z.1 | $ᵗ Bool] * Pr[= z.2 | $ᵗ Bool] := by simp

/-! # 2. Event probability — `Pr[ p | _]` -/

/-! ## Bounds
A probability is at most one and never `⊤`. -/

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (p : Bool → Prop) : Pr[p | mx] ≤ 1 := by simp
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (p : Bool → Prop) : Pr[p | mx] ≤ 1 := by grind

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (p : Bool → Prop) : Pr[p | mx] ≠ ⊤ := by simp
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (p : Bool → Prop) : Pr[p | mx] ≠ ⊤ := by grind

-- The impossible event has probability zero; a single fair outcome has probability one half.
-- target(grind): `grind` routes `Pr[fun _ => False]` through the support machinery and fails.
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) : Pr[fun _ => False | mx] = 0 := by simp
example : Pr[fun b => b = true | $ᵗ Bool] = 2⁻¹ := by simp
example : Pr[fun n => n < 3 | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] = 3 / 6 := by simp; rfl

/-! ## Monotonicity and complement
An event implies a wider event; the complement subtracts from one. -/

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (p q : Bool → Prop) (h : ∀ x, p x → q x) :
    Pr[p | mx] ≤ Pr[q | mx] := probEvent_mono'' h

example : Pr[fun b => b ≠ true | $ᵗ Bool] = 2⁻¹ := by simp

/-! ## Counting (favourable / total)
target(grind): the finite count needs `rfl` after the `probEvent_uniformSample` rewrite; ideally
`grind` evaluates the count itself. -/

example : Pr[fun n => n = 0 ∨ n = 1 | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] = 2 / 6 := by simp; rfl
example : Pr[fun p => p.1 = true ∨ p.2 = true | $ᵗ (Bool × Bool)] = 3 / 4 := by simp; congr 1

/-! ## Map pushforward
The event-probability of a map is the pulled-back event. -/

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (q : Fin 6 → Prop) (f : Bool → Fin 6) :
    Pr[q | f <$> mx] = Pr[q ∘ f | mx] := by simp

/-! # 3. Failure probability — `Pr[⊥ | _]` -/

/-! ## `ProbComp` never fails
A bare `ProbComp` computation — `pure`, a uniform draw, or any `bind` of them — fails with
probability zero. -/

example (x : Bool) : Pr[⊥ | (pure x : ProbComp Bool)] = 0 := by simp
example (x : Bool) : Pr[⊥ | (pure x : ProbComp Bool)] = 0 := by grind

example : Pr[⊥ | $ᵗ Bool] = 0 := by simp
example : Pr[⊥ | $ᵗ Bool] = 0 := by grind

example : Pr[⊥ | do let x ← $ᵗ Bool; let y ← $ᵗ Bool; pure (x && y)] = 0 := by simp
example : Pr[⊥ | do let x ← $ᵗ Bool; let y ← $ᵗ Bool; pure (x && y)] = 0 := by grind

example (α : Type) [SampleableType α] : Pr[⊥ | $ᵗ α] = 0 := by simp
example (α : Type) [SampleableType α] : Pr[⊥ | $ᵗ α] = 0 := by grind

/-! ## Selection and abort (`OptionT ProbComp`)
Selecting from the empty list fails with probability one; from a nonempty list it never fails. A
nonempty support means the computation does not certainly fail (`grind` via the `Set.Nonempty`
bridge). -/

example : Pr[⊥ | ($ ([] : List Bool) : OptionT ProbComp Bool)] = 1 := by simp
example : Pr[⊥ | ($ ([] : List Bool) : OptionT ProbComp Bool)] = 1 := by grind

example : Pr[⊥ | (failure : OptionT ProbComp Bool)] = 1 := by simp
example : Pr[⊥ | (failure : OptionT ProbComp Bool)] = 1 := by grind

example : Pr[⊥ | ($ ([true, false] : List Bool) : OptionT ProbComp Bool)] = 0 := by simp

example (mx : OptionT ProbComp Bool) (h : (support mx).Nonempty) : Pr[⊥ | mx] ≠ 1 := by grind
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (h : (support mx).Nonempty) : Pr[⊥ | mx] ≠ 1 := by grind

example (α : Type) [SampleableType α] : Pr[⊥ | $ᵗ α] ≠ 1 := by grind

/-! # 4. Support and finite support -/

/-! ## Singletons and universes
A `pure` computation is supported on its value; a uniform draw is supported everywhere. -/

example (x : Bool) : support (pure x : ProbComp Bool) = {x} := by simp
example (x : Bool) : support (pure x : ProbComp Bool) = {x} := by grind

example : support ($ᵗ Bool) = Set.univ := by simp
example : support ($ᵗ Bool) = Set.univ := by grind

example : finSupport ($ᵗ (Fin 6)) = Finset.univ := by simp
example : finSupport ($ᵗ (Fin 6)) = Finset.univ := by grind

example : finSupport (pure true : ProbComp Bool) = {true} := by simp
example : finSupport (pure true : ProbComp Bool) = {true} := by grind

example : support ($ᵗ (Bool × Bool)) = Set.univ := by simp
example : support ($ᵗ (Bool × Bool)) = Set.univ := by grind

example : support ($ᵗ (Vector Bool 2)) = Set.univ := by simp

example : support (do let b ← $ᵗ Bool; pure b) = Set.univ := by simp
example : support (do let b ← $ᵗ Bool; pure b) = Set.univ := by grind

/-! ## Membership
Every value is a possible outcome of a uniform draw. -/

example (x : Bool) : x ∈ support ($ᵗ Bool) := by simp
example (x : Bool) : x ∈ support ($ᵗ Bool) := by grind

example (x : Bool) : x ∈ finSupport ($ᵗ Bool) := by simp
example (x : Bool) : x ∈ finSupport ($ᵗ Bool) := by grind

example (x : Bool) : x ∈ support (pure x : ProbComp Bool) := by simp
example (x : Bool) : x ∈ support (pure x : ProbComp Bool) := by grind

example (α : Type) [SampleableType α] (x : α) : x ∈ support ($ᵗ α) := by grind

example (α : Type) [SampleableType α] : (support ($ᵗ α)).Nonempty := by grind

/-! ## The support ↔ probability bridge
A value has zero probability exactly when it is outside the support.

target(simp): `simp` rewrites the `= 0` side but cannot close the `Iff`; `grind` discharges it. -/

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) : Pr[= x | mx] = 0 ↔ x ∉ support mx := by grind

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) : 0 < Pr[= x | mx] ↔ x ∈ support mx := by simp
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) (x : Bool) : 0 < Pr[= x | mx] ↔ x ∈ support mx := by grind

/-! ## Structured supports
target(grind): a non-trivial `<$>`/`do` support equality needs `simp`'s computation normalisation
(and a set extensionality); `grind` would expand it instead. -/

example : support (do let b ← $ᵗ Bool; pure (!b)) = Set.univ := by
  ext b; cases b <;> simp

/-! # 5. Evaluation distribution — `𝒟[_]` -/

/-! ## `bind`/`pure` normalisation
A redundant `bind`/`pure` does not change the distribution. -/

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) : 𝒟[do let x ← mx; pure x] = 𝒟[mx] := by simp
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) : 𝒟[do let x ← mx; pure x] = 𝒟[mx] := by grind

example (mx : ProbComp Bool) : 𝒟[mx >>= pure] = 𝒟[mx] := by simp
example (mx : ProbComp Bool) : 𝒟[mx >>= pure] = 𝒟[mx] := by grind

/-! ## One-time-pad secrecy
Adding a uniform key makes the ciphertext distribution independent of the message (`ZMod 2` — a
one-bit XOR pad).

target(grind): this needs the translation-invariance lemma to fire before `evalDist_uniformSample`
unfolds the uniform draw, so it is `simp only`-terminal. -/

example (msg : ZMod 2) : 𝒟[(msg + ·) <$> ($ᵗ (ZMod 2))] = 𝒟[$ᵗ (ZMod 2)] := by
  simp only [evalDist_add_left_uniform]

/-! # 6. The shape of `do`
The automation should see through the full surface syntax of `do`-notation: a pure `let :=`, nested
blocks, pattern-matching binds, `if`/`then`/`else`, and long chains. None of these can fail. -/

/-- A pure `let :=` step inside `do`. -/
def coinThenNeg : ProbComp Bool := do
  let x ← $ᵗ Bool

example : Pr[= false | coinThenNeg] = Pr[= true | $ᵗ Bool] := by simp [coinThenNeg]

/-- Abort unless the coin comes up `true`: fails with probability one half. -/
def abortOnFalse : OptionT ProbComp Bool := do
  let b ← $ᵗ Bool
  if b then pure true else failure

example : Pr[⊥ | abortOnFalse] = 2⁻¹ := by
  simp [abortOnFalse, probFailure_bind_eq_add_tsum]

/-! # 7. Cryptography prerequisites
The kind of facts an intro-to-cryptography course assumes: guessing a uniform secret, collision
probability, and outcome probabilities summing to one. -/

example (guess : Fin 6) : Pr[= guess | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] = 6⁻¹ := by simp

example : Pr[fun p => p.1 = p.2 | $ᵗ (Fin 6 × Fin 6)] = 6 / 36 := by simp; rfl

example : ∑ k : Fin 6, Pr[= k | $ᵗ (Fin 6)] = 1 := sum_probOutput_eq_one (by simp)

/-! # 8. Abstract carriers
The same facts over an arbitrary `SampleableType` carrier. `grind` handles the symbolic ones
(equiprobability, never-fails, nonempty support); `grind` cannot factor the applicative product, so
the product equiprobability is `simp; grind` (`simp` factors, `grind` finishes). -/
