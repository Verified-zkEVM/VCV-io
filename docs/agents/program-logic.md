# Program Logic Tactics and Relational Reasoning

## Current Module Boundary

- Import `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics` for normal proof work. This is the canonical user-facing proof mode.
- Internally the tactic implementation is split into `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics.Unary` and
  `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics.Relational`; the umbrella import is still the intended default.
- `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Notation` provides the core notation and convenience predicates used by
  the tactic surface.
- Prefer the step-through tactics from `Tactics` for new proofs.
- `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Unary.StdDoBridge` is a narrow unary bridge for almost-sure correctness in the `.pure`
  `Std.Do` view. It is not the main engine for quantitative or relational VCGen.

## Tactic Quick Reference

### Proof Mode Entry

| Tactic | Goal shape | What it does |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `by_equiv` | `g₁ ≡ₚ g₂` or `evalDist g₁ = evalDist g₂` | Enters relational proof mode (`RelTriple`) |
| `game_trans g₂` | `g₁ ≡ₚ g₃` | Splits into `g₁ ≡ₚ g₂` and `g₂ ≡ₚ g₃` |
| `by_dist` | `AdvBound game ε` | Enters TV distance reasoning |
| `by_upto bad` | identical-until-bad TV-distance goals | Applies the `simulateQ` up-to-bad bound |
| `by_hoare` | `Pr[p \| oa] = ...` | Enters quantitative WP reasoning (legacy; prefer `vcstep` which lowers probability goals automatically) |

`by_equiv` enters the coupling-based `RelTriple` shell, not `RelTriple'`, so that
`rvcstep` / `rvcgen` can keep decomposing the relational goal.

`by_dist ε` is the explicit variant that fixes the TV-distance contribution to `ε`
before generating the remaining subgoals.

### Relational (pRHL) Tactics

| Tactic | Goal shape | What it does |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `rvcstep` | `g₁ ≡ₚ g₂`, `evalDist g₁ = evalDist g₂`, `⟪oa ~ ob \| R⟫`, or `⦃f⦄ oa ≈ₑ ob ⦃g⦄` | Lowers into relational mode if needed, then applies one obvious relational step |
| `rvcstep using t` | same | Supplies the explicit witness needed by the current shape (bind cut relation, bijection, traversal input relation, or simulation state relation) |
| `rvcstep with thm` | same | Force one explicit relational theorem/assumption step |
| `rvcstep?` | same | Performs one relational step and emits a `Try this` script, usually surfacing a needed `using` hint, `with theorem`, or `as ⟨...⟩` clause |
| `rvcgen` | same | Repeats relational VCGen across all current goals until stuck |
| `rvcgen using t` | same | Uses `t` for the first step on the main goal, then continues with ordinary `rvcgen` |
| `rvcgen with thm` | same | Uses `thm` for the first step on the main goal, then continues with ordinary `rvcgen` |
| `rvcgen?` | same | Runs `rvcgen` and emits the corresponding explicit script |
| `rel_conseq` | `⟪oa ~ ob \| R'⟫` | Weakens/strengthens postcondition |
| `rel_inline foo` | `⟪... ~ ... \| R⟫` | Unfolds definitions, simplifies |
| `rel_dist` | `⟪oa ~ ob \| EqRel α⟫` | Exits relational mode back to `evalDist oa = evalDist ob` |

### Optional arguments

- `rvcstep using R` — on bind goals, provide the intermediate relation explicitly
- `rvcstep using f` — on random/query goals, provide the coupling bijection explicitly.
  On a synchronized bind goal whose left/right scrutinees are uniform samples or queries,
  the same `using f` form is also accepted as a *bijection-coupling bind*: it cuts with
  `R := fun a b => b = f a`, closes the sample subgoal via
  `relTriple_uniformSample_bij` (or `relTriple_query_bij`), and substitutes the equality
  on the continuation, leaving the user with the continuation goal followed by the
  `Function.Bijective f` side condition
- `rvcstep using Rin` — on `List.mapM` / `List.foldlM` goals, provide the input relation
- `rvcstep using R_state` — on `simulateQ` goals, provide the state invariant relation
- `rvcstep with thm` — force one explicit registered/local relational theorem
- `rvcstep as ⟨x₁, x₂, h⟩` — explicitly name the binders introduced by the current step
- `rvcgen using t` / `rvcgen with thm` — use one explicit first hint/theorem, then keep stepping automatically
- `rel_conseq with R` — provide explicit weaker postcondition

### Quantitative VCGen (`vcgen`)

`vcgen` is the primary unary tactic for new proofs. It accepts both `Triple` goals and
probability goals, automatically lowering `Pr[...]` into the quantitative engine.

| Tactic | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `vcgen` | Exhaustively decomposes a `Triple` or probability goal with spec-aware stepping, loop invariant auto-detection, and support/indicator leaf closure |
| `vcstep` | One step: probability lowering → bind → conditional → match → loop → leaf |
| `vcstep?` | Performs one step and emits the corresponding explicit script, often surfacing `as ⟨...⟩`, `using cut`, `inv I`, or `with theorem` |
| `vcgen?` | Runs `vcgen` and emits the planned step replay across each pass |
| `vcstep using cut` | Explicit intermediate postcondition for a bind step |
| `vcstep with thm` | Force one explicit unary theorem/assumption step |
| `vcstep as ⟨x, hx⟩` | Explicit names for binders introduced by the current step |
| `vcstep inv I` | Explicit loop invariant for `replicate`/`foldlM`/`mapM` |
| `vcstep rw` | One explicit top-level bind-swap rewrite on a `Pr[...] = Pr[...]` goal |
| `vcstep rw under n` | One bind-swap rewrite under `n` shared outer bind prefixes |
| `vcstep rw congr` | Expose one or more shared binds plus their support hypotheses |
| `vcstep rw congr'` | Expose one or more shared binds without support hypotheses |
| `exp_norm` | Normalize indicator (`propInd`) and expectation (`wp`) arithmetic |

**Probability-goal handling**: `vcgen` and `vcstep` automatically handle four
classes of probability goals:

1. **`Pr[...] = 1` lowering** → rewrites into `Triple` form for structural decomposition:
   - `Pr[p | oa] = 1` → `Triple 1 oa (fun x => ⌜p x⌝)`
   - `Pr[= x | oa] = 1` → `Triple 1 oa (fun y => if y = x then 1 else 0)`

2. **Lower-bound event/output goals** → stay inside unary VCGen by reusing the same `Triple`
   shell:
   - `r ≤ Pr[p | oa]` / `Pr[p | oa] ≥ r` → `Triple r oa (fun x => ⌜p x⌝)`
   - `r ≤ Pr[= x | oa]` / `Pr[= x | oa] ≥ r` → `Triple r oa (fun y => if y = x then 1 else 0)`

3. **`Pr[...] = Pr[...]` equality**:
   - Plain `vcstep` first normalizes common `map`/`bind` surface syntax (`map_eq_bind_pure_comp`,
     `bind_assoc`), then preview-selects the best bounded swap/congruence plan from the fast path
   - `vcstep rw` performs exactly one top-level bind-swap rewrite
   - `vcstep rw under n` rewrites one swap beneath `n` shared outer bind prefixes
   - `vcstep rw congr` / `vcstep rw congr'` expose one or more shared binds explicitly

4. **Other general `Pr[...]` goals** → rewrite to raw `wp` form and keep stepping structurally
   when a `wp` rule applies. On an already-lowered raw-`wp` goal, `vcstep?` / `vcgen?`
   will explicitly note that they are continuing in raw `wp` mode.

**Loop invariants**: `vcgen` auto-detects `replicate`, `List.foldlM`, and `List.mapM`
in `Triple` goals and applies matching invariant hypotheses from context.
Use `vcstep inv I` to provide an explicit invariant.

**Support-sensitive leaf closure**: `vcgen` final pass tries `triple_support`,
`triple_propInd_of_support`, `triple_probEvent_eq_one`, and `triple_probOutput_eq_one`
in addition to the standard `triple_pure`, `triple_zero`, and consequence search.

**Naming and suggestions**: plain `vcstep` / `rvcstep` keep the stable execution path.
The `?` variants run a planner-backed version of the same next move and emit a concrete
`Try this` script, typically surfacing an explicit `using ...` hint, `inv I`, `with theorem`,
or `as ⟨...⟩` clause that you can paste back into the proof. On probability-equality goals the
planner may emit a grouped multi-step replay when the best explanation is an explicit rewrite chain.

**Opt-in unary lookup**: mark a unary `Triple` or raw `wp` theorem with `@[vcspec]` to register it for
bounded head-symbol lookup. This is intentionally narrow: after the built-in structural step and
explicit hint opportunities, `vcstep` / `vcgen` consult only `@[vcspec]` theorems whose
computation head matches the current goal. Use `vcstep with myLemma` when you want to force
one specific theorem/assumption step manually.

**Opt-in relational lookup**: mark a relational `RelTriple`, `RelWP`, or quantitative
`Std.Do'.RelTriple` theorem with `@[vcspec]` to register it for the analogous bounded
head-pair lookup on the relational side.
This is especially useful for automation-oriented `simulateQ` transport lemmas whose outer
computation heads are stable but whose inner invariants or projection arguments still come from
the local context. The default registry already covers the structural relational rules
(`relTriple_pure_pure`, `relTriple_bind`, `relTriple_map`, `relTriple_if`, the `replicate` /
`mapM` / `foldlM` / `uniformSample_bij` families, the quantitative
`Std.Do'.RelTriple` pure / bind / uniform-sampling families, and the two `simulateQ`
transport rules),
so user-defined rules slot into the same lookup pipeline without further wiring.

### Handler Normalization

| Tactic | Goal shape | What it does |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `handler_step` | handler-heavy `QueryImpl` / `simulateQ` / `StateT` goals | Runs one `simp only [handler_simp]` normalization pass to expose the next handler body or run-shape |

`handler_step` is deliberately thin. Use it when a proof is stuck behind
handler combinators such as cache overlays, logging handlers, counting
handlers, or state-transformer maps; then continue with `vcstep`, `rvcstep`,
`rvcgen`, or direct proof steps.

**Opt-in `wp`-rewrite lookup**: mark an equational rewrite of shape
`wp comp post = …` with `@[wpStep]` to extend the inner `wp`-stepping driver
(`runWpStepRules`). The driver indexes registered rules by the path of `comp`
in a `Lean.Meta.Sym`-backed discrimination tree: pattern construction goes
through `Lean.Meta.Sym.mkPatternFromDeclWithKey`, which preprocesses the rule's
LHS (unfolding reducibles, beta/zeta/eta normalizing) and turns universally
quantified arguments into de Bruijn pattern variables, while
`Lean.Meta.Sym.insertPattern` automatically wildcards proof / instance
positions in the discrimination-tree key. Lookup at dispatch time is the pure
`Lean.Meta.Sym.DiscrTree.getMatch` after a `withReducible whnf` on the goal's
`comp` to align with the preprocessed patterns. Each match is then tried via
`rw`, falling back to `simp only`. The default registry already covers
`wp_pure`, `wp_bind`, `wp_ite`, `wp_dite`, `wp_map`, the `replicate` / `mapM`
/ `foldlM` families, `wp_query`, `wp_uniformSample`, and the `simulateQ` /
`liftComp` transport rules, so user-authored `wp` lemmas slot into the same
dispatch without further wiring.

**Bind normalization**: `rvcstep` (and therefore `rvcgen`) runs a best-effort
`simp only [bind_assoc, pure_bind, bind_pure_comp, Functor.map_map, map_pure]` pre-pass on the
relational goal before deciding which structural rule to apply. This flattens nested binds and
strips pure-bind layers so that the bind decomposition rule fires on aligned shapes, and so that
goals that simplify to pure-pure or refl close immediately.

**Augmented leaf closure**: the relational leaf closer (`tryCloseRelGoalImmediate`, plus its
`rvcgen` finishing pass) tries, in order:
1. `assumption`
2. `relTriple_true _ _` (the postcondition is structurally `fun _ _ => True`, discharged via
   the universal product coupling, since `OracleComp` has no failure mass);
3. `relTriple_post_const ?_; intros; trivial` (the postcondition reduces to a trivially provable
   proposition such as `() = ()` after introduction);
4. `relTriple_refl` / `relTriple_eqRel_of_eq rfl` / `relTriple_pure_pure` /
   quantitative `Std.Do'.RelTriple` pure (canonical reflexive and pure-pure leaves);
5. a `subst_vars`-driven retry of the same closers (resolves syntactically-distinct pure
   values unified by local equality hypotheses);
6. a symmetric `relTriple_pure_pure ∘ symm` step for postconditions written in the swapped
   direction.

**Pass budget**: exhaustive `vcgen` / `rvcgen` runs are bounded by
`set_option vcvio.vcgen.maxPasses <n>`. The default is conservative so large proofs stay
predictable; if you intentionally want a longer exhaustive run, raise the option locally around
that proof.

**Trace output**: set `set_option vcvio.vcgen.traceSteps true` to log the chosen planned step,
goal delta, and any planner alternatives that were previewed while debugging tactic choice.

### Raw WP Tactics

Raw `wp` goals (`_ ≤ wp _ _`) now use the same unary entrypoints rather than a separate tactic
family. `vcstep` performs one decomposition step and `vcgen` keeps stepping exhaustively.


### Probability Equality Control

All probability-equality control now lives under `vcstep`.

| Tactic | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `vcstep` | Fast dispatcher for common `Pr[...] = Pr[...]` steps: syntax normalization, swap, congruence, and bounded compositions chosen by preview |
| `vcstep rw` | Rewrites one top-level bind swap without trying to close the goal |
| `vcstep rw under n` | Rewrites one bind swap under `n` shared outer bind prefixes on one side |
| `vcstep rw congr` | Reduces `Pr[... \| mx >>= f₁] = Pr[... \| mx >>= f₂]` to a pointwise goal, auto-introducing `x` and `hx : x ∈ support mx`; the explicit `as ⟨...⟩` form can peel multiple shared binds at once |
| `vcstep rw congr'` | Same, but without the support restriction; the explicit `as ⟨...⟩` form can peel multiple shared binds at once |

### Automation

| Tactic | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `rvcgen` | Exhaustive relational VCGen over all open goals, with automatic lowering from `GameEquiv` / `evalDist` equality |
| `rel_dist` | Turns `RelTriple oa ob (EqRel α)` into `evalDist oa = evalDist ob` |

## Probability Equality Guide

### What plain `vcstep` handles

On `Pr[...] = Pr[...]` goals, plain `vcstep` already tries the common
`probEvent_bind_bind_swap` / bind-congruence patterns:

1. **Direct `probOutput` equalities**: `Pr[= x | mx >>= ... >>= ...] = Pr[= x | my >>= ... >>= ...]`
2. **Nested bounded rewrites**: automatically peels small shared-bind prefixes and prefers a
   closing swap/congruence plan when one is available
3. **Surface `map` wrappers**: normalizes the common `map_eq_bind_pure_comp` / `bind_assoc` shape
   before searching for swaps or congruence

### When to use the explicit `rw` subcommands

- **Need to keep going after a swap**: use `vcstep rw`
- **Need to swap below shared outer binds**: use `vcstep rw under n`
- **Need to expose one or more common outer binds with support information**: use `vcstep rw congr`
- **Need the support-free congruence variant**: use `vcstep rw congr'`
- **Need the full explicit replay for a bounded nested swap**: use `vcstep?`
- **Need a deeper swap than the current bounded automation knows**: peel outer layers manually, or
  use `vcstep?` to see the best bounded replay the planner found before finishing the rest by hand

### Key insight: `probOutput` vs `probEvent`

The underlying bind-swap lemma `probEvent_bind_bind_swap` works with `probEvent`.
Most crypto proofs use `probOutput`. The `vcstep` probability-equality machinery
bridges between them with `probEvent_eq_eq_probOutput` when needed.

### Patterns

**Standalone swap**:
```lean
vcstep
```

**Rewrite one swap and continue**:
```lean
vcstep rw
```

**Rewrite under one shared bind**:
```lean
vcstep rw under 1
```

**Expose one common bind with support information**:
```lean
vcstep rw congr
exact h _ ‹_›
```

**Expose one common bind without support information**:
```lean
vcstep rw congr'
rename_i x
```

**Expose two shared binds explicitly at once**:
```lean
vcstep rw congr' as ⟨x, y⟩
```

## Relational Infrastructure

### RelTriple (pRHL coupling)

```lean
abbrev RelPost (α β : Type) := α → β → Prop
def EqRel (α : Type) : RelPost α α := fun x y => x = y

-- ⟪oa ~ ob | R⟫
abbrev RelTriple (oa : OracleComp spec₁ α) (ob : OracleComp spec₂ β)
    (R : RelPost α β) : Prop
```

Key rules:

| Rule | Use |
|------|-----|
| `relTriple_pure_pure` | Both sides are `pure`, prove `R a b` |
| `relTriple_bind` | Decompose bind on both sides |
| `relTriple_refl` | Same computation → `EqRel` |
| `relTriple_eqRel_of_eq` | Definitionally equal → `EqRel` |
| `relTriple_eqRel_of_evalDist_eq` | Same distribution → `EqRel` |
| `relTriple_query` | Same query → `EqRel` on response |
| `relTriple_query_bij` | Same query with bijection `f` → `fun a b => f a = b` |
| `relTriple_uniformSample_bij` | Uniform sampling with bijection |
| `relTriple_if` | Synchronized conditional |
| `relTriple_post_mono` | Weaken postcondition |
| `evalDist_eq_of_relTriple_eqRel` | Extract `evalDist` equality from `EqRel` triple |

### Relational simulateQ

For oracle simulation with state invariants:

```lean
relTriple_simulateQ_run :
  (∀ t s₁ s₂, R_state s₁ s₂ → RelTriple ((impl₁ t).run s₁) ((impl₂ t).run s₂)
    (fun p₁ p₂ => p₁.1 = p₂.1 ∧ R_state p₁.2 p₂.2)) →
  R_state s₁ s₂ →
  RelTriple ((simulateQ impl₁ oa).run s₁) ((simulateQ impl₂ oa).run s₂)
    (fun p₁ p₂ => p₁.1 = p₂.1 ∧ R_state p₁.2 p₂.2)
```

### Handler `@[spec]` catalog (`Unary/HandlerSpecs.lean`)

Per-call `Std.Do.Triple` specs, all tagged `@[spec]` so `mvcgen` can
compose them automatically through multi-query handler programs:

| Handler | Spec | Postcondition |
|---------|------|---------------|
| `cachingOracle` | `cachingOracle_triple` | `cache₀ ≤ cache' ∧ cache' t = some v` (shared live-query + cache-monotonicity) |
| `seededOracle` | `seededOracle_triple` | branch on `seed t`: `nil → no-op`, `cons u us → pop head` |
| `loggingOracle` | `loggingOracle_triple` | `log' = log₀ ++ [⟨t, v⟩]` (always extend the log) |
| `countingOracle` | `countingOracle_triple` | `qc' = qc₀ + QueryCount.single t` (monoid variant of `WriterT` bridge) |
| `costOracle` | `costOracle_triple` | `s' = s₀ * costFn t` for arbitrary `[Monoid ω]` |

The `WriterT`-based handlers come in both `Append`-parameterized
(`loggingOracle`) and `Monoid`-parameterized (`countingOracle`,
`costOracle`) flavors; the corresponding bridge lemmas
`triple_writerT_iff_forall_support` and
`triple_writerT_iff_forall_support_monoid` live in `Unary/StdDoBridge.lean`.

### Whole-program invariant preservation (`SimSemantics/PreservesInv.lean`)

Support-based invariant-preservation over `simulateQ`, for both the
state-transformer and writer-transformer models:

| Definition | Shape | Meaning |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `QueryImpl.PreservesInv` | `σ → Prop` | every `(impl t).run σ₀` keeps the state invariant |
| `QueryImpl.WriterPreservesInv` | `ω → Prop` under `[Monoid ω]` | every `(impl t).run` step keeps `s₀ * w` satisfying `Inv` |
| `QueryImpl.WriterPreservesInv.of_mul_closed` | — | canonical builder: `Q` closed under `*` and holding on per-query increments yields `WriterPreservesInv` |
| `OracleComp.simulateQ_run_preservesInv` | — | lift per-query `PreservesInv` to whole simulation |
| `OracleComp.simulateQ_run_writerPreservesInv` | — | writer analogue |

`Std.Do.Triple`-fronted whole-program lifts (`Unary/HandlerSpecs.lean`):

| Theorem | Shape |
|---------|-------|
| `simulateQ_triple_preserves_invariant` | `StateT` version |
| `simulateQ_writerT_triple_preserves_invariant` | `WriterT` (monoid) version |

`WriterPreservesInv` is the canonical invariant-preservation API for
writer-based handlers like `countingOracle`/`costOracle`. Typical use:
pick `Inv s := s ≤ B` (cost-budget) or `Inv s := s ∈ Submonoid.S` (stays
in a submonoid).

Worked examples in `HandlerSpecs.lean`:

| Example | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| `simulateQ_cachingOracle_preserves_cache_le` | Whole-simulation cache monotonicity for `cachingOracle` (`StateT`) |
| `simulateQ_cachingLoggingOracle_preserves_cache_le` / `..._log_prefix` | Stacked `StateT` handler preserves each component's invariant |
| `simulateQ_countingOracle_preserves_ge` | Whole-simulation count monotonicity for `countingOracle` via the `WriterT` lift with `I qc := qc₀ ≤ qc` |
| `simulateQ_costOracle_preserves_submonoid` | Submonoid closure: if `costFn t ∈ S` for every `t`, the accumulated cost stays in `S` |

### Unary-to-relational handler lift (`Relational/HandlerFromUnary.lean`)

If each handler has a `Std.Do.Triple` spec (produced by `mvcgen` or a
`@[spec]` lemma), you do not have to assemble per-call `RelTriple`s by
hand. The lift converts unary handler specs plus a synchronization
condition into a whole-program `RelTriple`:

```lean
relTriple_simulateQ_run_of_triples :
  (∀ t s, Triple (impl₁ t) ⌜· = s⌝ (⇓a s' => ⌜Q₁ t s a s'⌝)) →
  (∀ t s, Triple (impl₂ t) ⌜· = s⌝ (⇓a s' => ⌜Q₂ t s a s'⌝)) →
  (hsync : Q₁ ∧ Q₂ ⇒ output equality + R_state preservation) →
  R_state s₁ s₂ →
  RelTriple ((simulateQ impl₁ oa).run s₁) ((simulateQ impl₂ oa).run s₂)
    (fun p₁ p₂ => p₁.1 = p₂.1 ∧ R_state p₁.2 p₂.2)
```

Projection and bridge variants:

| Variant | Use when |
|---------|----------|
| `relTriple_simulateQ_run_of_triples` | Full `(value, state)` postcondition (`StateT`) |
| `relTriple_simulateQ_run'_of_triples` | Only `EqRel α` on projected outputs (`StateT`) |
| `relTriple_simulateQ_run_of_impl_eq_triple` | Two handlers agreeing on `Inv`; preservation spec is a `Std.Do.Triple`; conclude `EqRel (α × σ)` |
| `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT` | Whole-program `WriterT` coupling from per-query `RelTriple`s plus a monoid-congruence hypothesis on the accumulated writers |
| `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT'` | Output-projection of `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT` (drops the writer component, yielding `EqRel α` on outputs) |
| `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT_of_impl_eq` | `WriterT` analogue of `relTriple_simulateQ_run_of_impl_eq_preservesInv`: two handlers with identical `.run` outputs yield `EqRel (α × ω)` on whole simulations |
| `probOutput_simulateQ_run_writerT_eq_of_impl_eq` | Output-probability projection of `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT_of_impl_eq` |
| `evalDist_simulateQ_run_writerT_eq_of_impl_eq` | `evalDist` equality projection of `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT_of_impl_eq` |
| `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT_of_triples` | `WriterT` handler-level whole-program lift from unary triples (monoid variant) |
| `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT'_of_triples` | Output-projection of `relTriple_simulateQ_run_writerT_of_triples` |
| `relTriple_run_of_triple` | Per-call product coupling for `StateT` |
| `relTriple_run_writerT_of_triple` | Per-call product coupling for `WriterT` (`Append` variant, e.g. `loggingOracle`) |
| `relTriple_run_writerT_of_triple_monoid` | Per-call product coupling for `WriterT` (`Monoid` variant, e.g. `countingOracle`, `costOracle`) |
| `support_preservesInv_of_triple` | Convert `Std.Do.Triple` preservation into `support`-based preservation consumed by `SimulateQ.lean` (`StateT`) |
| `writerPreservesInv_of_triple` | `WriterT` analogue: produces `QueryImpl.WriterPreservesInv impl Inv` from a per-query `Std.Do.Triple` |

Whenever the handler's invariant-preservation proof already lives as a
`Std.Do.Triple`, prefer `relTriple_simulateQ_run_of_impl_eq_triple` over
the raw `relTriple_simulateQ_run_of_impl_eq_preservesInv` — the bridge
saves you from re-expressing the preservation as a `support`-based
quantifier.

### Identical Until Bad

```lean
tvDist_simulateQ_le_probEvent_bad :
  (¬bad s₀) →
  (∀ t s, ¬bad s → (impl₁ t).run s = (impl₂ t).run s) →
  (bad monotone for impl₁ and impl₂) →
  tvDist ((simulateQ impl₁ oa).run' s₀) ((simulateQ impl₂ oa).run' s₀)
    ≤ Pr[bad ∘ Prod.snd | (simulateQ impl₁ oa).run s₀].toReal
```

### eRHL (quantitative relational logic)

```lean
-- ⦃f⦄ c₁ ≈ₑ c₂ ⦃g⦄
Std.Do'.RelTriple pre oa ob post Lean.Order.bot Lean.Order.bot
-- definitionally unfolds to:
pre ≤ eRelWP oa ob post

-- ⟪c₁ ≈[ε] c₂ | R⟫
def ApproxRelTriple (ε : ℝ≥0∞) (oa ob : ...) (R : RelPost α β) : Prop :=
  1 - ε ≤ eRelWP oa ob (RelPost.indicator R)
```

pRHL is the special case where `ε = 0` (exact coupling).

### Design target

eRHL is the design target for relational program logic in this repo. When extending the
logic, build the quantitative `ℝ≥0∞` foundation first, then recover pRHL and apRHL as
special cases via indicator postconditions. Do not add a pRHL-only layer that bypasses
the quantitative foundation.

The current tactic UX is still pRHL-flavored because the interactive proof shell is
`RelTriple`. That is intentional: exact coupling is the most ergonomic step-through mode
today, even though the semantic design target remains eRHL-first.

Before changing the eRHL / pRHL / apRHL design, consult
*A Quantitative Probabilistic Relational Hoare Logic* ([ERHL25](../../REFERENCES.md#erhl25)).
Treat the published paper as the authoritative source for the intended relational WP
design. For the historical pRHL lineage behind exact coupling, see
[PRHL14](../../REFERENCES.md#prhl14).

## Game-Hopping Proof Skeleton

```lean
theorem my_security : g₁ ≡ₚ gₙ := by
  game_trans g₂
  · by_equiv            -- g₁ ≡ₚ g₂ via coupling
    rvcstep using R
    · rvcstep using f
      · exact hf
      · intro x
        exact hR x
    · intro a b hab
      rvcgen
  · game_trans g₃       -- g₂ ≡ₚ gₙ
    · ...
    · ...
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Plain `vcstep` may close or progress a probability equality goal**: use
   `vcstep rw` / `vcstep rw under n` when you specifically want a rewrite and
   intend to continue.

2. **Import `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics`**: tactics are defined there. If a file only imports `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Notation`, add/change the import.

3. **`game_rule` simp set**: many tactics use `simp only [game_rule]` internally. Ensure relevant `@[simp]` lemmas are in scope.

4. **`rvcstep using R`**: when Lean can't infer the witness for the current relational shape
   (bind cut, bijection, traversal input relation, or simulation invariant), provide it explicitly.

5. **`StdDoBridge` is deliberately narrow**: use it for unary almost-sure `.pure` `Std.Do` experiments, not as the default path for quantitative or relational proofs.

## Internal Architecture (`Sym`-backed Registries)

### Why `Lean.Meta.Sym.*`?

The planner needs to ask "given this `wp comp post` or `Triple pre comp post`
goal, which registered rules could fire?" *fast*, and without the cost or
surprises of `isDefEq` unfolding. Core Lean has been building a dedicated
symbolic toolkit under `Lean.Meta.Sym` precisely for this: `Sym.Pattern`
records a de Bruijn-encoded skeleton of the indexed sub-expression together
with its normalizing preprocess (`preprocessType` unfolds reducible
abbreviations, beta/zeta/eta-reduces, and elaborates universes); `Sym.DiscrTree`
is a thin wrapper over `Lean.Meta.DiscrTree` whose insertion keys come from
those preprocessed patterns and whose lookup is the pure structural
`getMatch`. Core also ships a `Sym.Simp.Theorems` bundle (discrimination-tree
+ `Sym.Simp.Theorem` records) used by the upcoming `mvcgen'` frontend; we do
not consume it today (see *Future `mvcgen` bridge (deferred)* below) but
`Sym.Simp.mkTheoremFromDecl` lets us reconstruct it on demand from the
`@[wpStep]` registry once the `SymM → TacticM` proof-application bridge
stabilises in core.

Building on `Sym.Pattern` + `Sym.DiscrTree` means our registries share the
same pattern preprocessing and lookup cost profile as future core tactics,
and the migration to `Sym.Simp.*`-driven rewriting is a localised follow-up
in two registry files rather than a framework rewrite.

### Registries and what they index

| File | Attribute | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `Common/Registry.lean` | `@[vcspec]` | Unary and relational `Triple` / `RelTriple` / `RelWP` / quantitative `Std.Do'.RelTriple` rules, indexed by a `Sym.Pattern` on the computation slot (`oa` for unary, `oa` with a secondary `rightHead?` filter for relational) |
| `Common/WpStepRegistry.lean` | `@[wpStep]` | Equational `wp comp post = …` rewrites, indexed by a `Sym.Pattern` on `oa` and consulted by `runWpStepRules` via `TacticM` rewriting (`rw` then `simp only`). The `Sym.Simp.Theorem` bundle for an eventual `SymM`-side rewriter is *not* eagerly built; `Sym.Simp.mkTheoremFromDecl` can rebuild it on demand from `getAllWpStepEntries` |

Each entry carries a `SpecProof` (reusing the core-Lean type from
`Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.SpecAttr`) so origins can be distinguished between a
global declaration, a local hypothesis, or a raw term. Priorities are parsed
from the attribute's optional priority argument (`@[vcspec (prio := 200)]`).

### Dispatch flow

1. **Unary / relational VC-gen** (`Unary/Internals.lean`,
   `Relational/Internals.lean`): on a `Triple`/`wp`/`RelTriple`/`RelWP`/quantitative
   `Std.Do'.RelTriple`
   goal, the planner extracts the computation slot(s), `whnfReducible`s them,
   asks the registry for candidate `VCSpecEntry`s via
   `getRegisteredUnaryVCSpecEntries` / `getRegisteredRelationalVCSpecEntries`,
   filters by `kind` and `spec.compPattern`, previews each candidate (via the
   shared `runUnaryVCSpecRule` / `runRelationalVCSpecRule` helpers which call
   the `runVCGenStepWithTheoremDirect` / `runRVCGenStepWithTheoremDirect`
   applicators), and picks the best plan.
2. **`wp`-rewrite driver** (`Common/WpStepDispatch.lean`): on any goal
   containing `wp _ _`, `runWpStepRules` pulls the `oa` argument out of the
   first matching `wp` application, `whnfReducible`s it, asks
   `getRegisteredWpStepEntries` for hits on the `oa`-keyed `Sym.DiscrTree`,
   and tries each via `rw` then `simp only` until one lands.
3. **Handler `@[spec]` rules**: unary handlers (`loggingOracle`,
   `cachingOracle`, …) use core Lean's `Std.Do.Triple` + `@[spec]` catalogue
   directly; those are indexed by Lean itself and consumed by `mvcgen`.

### Extending the registries

| Want to add… | Tag it with | Expected shape |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| A unary Triple lemma usable by `vcstep` / `vcgen` | `@[vcspec]` | `Triple pre oa post` or raw `wp oa post ≥ pre` |
| A relational lemma usable by `rvcstep` / `rvcgen` | `@[vcspec]` | `RelTriple oa ob R`, `RelWP oa ob post`, or quantitative `Std.Do'.RelTriple pre oa ob post Lean.Order.bot Lean.Order.bot` |
| A `wp`-driven equational rewrite | `@[wpStep]` | `wp comp post = …` (exact head `wp`) |

Priorities (`@[vcspec (prio := 200)]`, `@[wpStep (prio := 200)]`) follow the
standard Lean convention: higher priority entries are tried first within the
same candidate pool.

## SymM Stability Note and Future Proof Repair

`Lean.Meta.Sym.*` is still under active development in core Lean. The APIs
we depend on today (`Sym.Pattern`, `Sym.DiscrTree`, `Sym.insertPattern`,
`Sym.getMatch`, `Sym.mkPatternFromDeclWithKey`, and `SpecProof` in
`Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.SpecAttr`) are all used by `mvcgen`/`mvcgen'` in core
too, so their direction is broadly stable, but none of them carry a
compat-preservation promise yet. Expect the following classes of churn each
time we bump the toolchain:

- **Signature changes on `Sym.mkPatternFromDeclWithKey`**. If the selector
  signature changes (e.g. becomes `Expr → MetaM (Pattern × α)` instead of
  `Expr → MetaM (Expr × α)`), update `buildVCSpecEntry` /
  `buildWpStepEntry` in `Registry.lean` / `WpStepRegistry.lean` to match.
- **`Sym.Pattern` preprocessing behaviour**. If the default reducibility
  used by `preprocessType` shifts (e.g. stops unfolding certain abbreviations
  or starts unfolding more), the "folded vs unfolded head" helpers
  (`headIsOneOf`, `tripleBodyParts?`, `relTripleBodyParts?`, etc. in
  `Registry.lean`) may need to grow new cases. All of these live in a
  clearly-marked `Preprocessed-body head matchers` section.
- **`Sym.Simp.Theorem` field renames / `mkTheoremFromDecl` moves**. We do
  *not* call `mkTheoremFromDecl` today (the dispatcher works off the
  `Sym.DiscrTree` alone). When the deferred `mvcgen'`/`SymM` bridge lands,
  this is where we'll need to pick the bundle back up; until then this
  churn class is no-op for us.
- **`SpecProof` variants**. We only use `.global` today. If core splits or
  merges variants, `VCSpecEntry.declName?` / `WpStepEntry.declName?` plus
  the matching `MetaM` inserts need to be adjusted.
- **`registerSimpleScopedEnvExtension` purity**. `addEntry` is pure today
  and we rely on that in both registries; if it changes, the attribute
  handlers already compute their patterns inside `MetaM` before calling
  `.add`, so the fix is to thread the `MetaM` result differently, not to
  restructure the registry.

The compensating design choices are: keep `Sym`-aware logic contained to the
registry modules (`Registry.lean`, `WpStepRegistry.lean`), prefer the
structural `getMatch` over `isDefEq`, and keep an explicit `TacticM`
fallback path (`rw` / `simp only`) so failures in any single `Sym` lookup
stage degrade gracefully.

### Future `mvcgen` bridge (deferred)

Lean v4.29.0 ships `mvcgen` with the classical `Std.Do` handler catalogue
but does *not* expose a `SymM`-level rewriter we can hand a goal to (the
`mvcgen'` pilot lives on a newer toolchain). The planned shape of that
bridge, for when the API lands:

1. Build a `Sym.Simp.Theorems` bundle from the union of `@[wpStep]` and
   `@[vcspec]` registries by mapping `Sym.Simp.mkTheoremFromDecl` over
   `getAllWpStepEntries` (and the analogous `@[vcspec]` accessor). We do
   not eagerly maintain the bundle in the env extension because it only
   feeds the deferred SymM rewriter and pulls in `Lean.Meta.Sym.Simp.*`.
2. Translate the current `wp`-bearing goal into `Sym.Simp.SimpM` and run
   `Sym.Simp.Theorems.rewrite thms goal` (or whichever `simpImpl` variant
   core exposes). Results come back as a `Sym.Simp.Step`.
3. Reify the resulting rewritten goal and proof term back into `TacticM`
   via the standard `SymM → MetaM` reifier that accompanies `mvcgen'` in
   core. Until that reifier is public, we cannot close the loop; the
   current `TacticM`-side dispatch covers the same rules without it.

Treat any `Sym.*` bump to Lean core as a signal to re-read the two
registry files and the `runWpStepRules` docstring. If a bump breaks us,
the fastest recovery path is: (1) open the failing file, (2) check that
`Sym.mkPatternFromDeclWithKey`, `Sym.insertPattern`, `Sym.getMatch`, and
`Sym.Simp.mkTheoremFromDecl` still have matching signatures, (3) rebuild
the single `Common/Registry.lean` or `Common/WpStepRegistry.lean`
target, and (4) regenerate the full library. No user-visible tactic
surface changes.
