# One-Time Pad at the UC Observation Layer

This file wires the one-time pad from `Examples.OneTimePad.Basic` into
the `Interaction.UC.Semantics` observation framework, giving a
`ObservedCompEmulates 0` statement at the observation level.

## Canonical UC story being modeled

In the Universal Composability literature, OTP is the canonical bridge
from symmetric-key privacy to a **Secure Message Transmission**
functionality `F_SMT`. The standard setup is:

* **Real protocol** `π_OTP`. The sender samples a one-time key
  `k ← uniform`, computes `c := k ⊕ m`, and delivers `c` on the
  (authenticated) channel. The receiver recovers `m` via `k ⊕ c`.
* **Ideal functionality** `F_SMT`. The sender hands `m` directly to
  the ideal party; the environment learns only what `F_SMT` chooses
  to leak on its public interface (in the simplest formulation,
  only `|m|`).
* **Simulator** `S`. Wraps `F_SMT` to match `π_OTP`'s public
  interface by sampling a uniform ciphertext `c' ← uniform` and
  delivering it to the environment.

The OTP privacy statement is that the environment's joint view in the
real world and in the ideal world have the same distribution. The
content is "XOR against a uniform one-time key is uniform", i.e.
`k ⊕ m ∼ uniform` for every `m`.

## What this file formalizes

We model the two views at the **observation layer**:

* `realCipherObserve sp msg P` samples a uniform key `k`, computes
  `c := k ⊕ msg`, and `guard`s `P c = true`. This is the real
  world's ciphertext-plus-distinguisher bit.
* `idealCipherObserve sp P` samples a uniform ciphertext `c` directly
  and `guard`s `P c = true`. This is the ideal world's view under
  the canonical simulator, which replaces the OTP ciphertext with a
  fresh uniform sample.

The central lemma `evalDist_realCipherObserve_eq` transports OTP
perfect secrecy to the sub-probabilistic observation target: the
`SPMF Unit` denotations of the real and ideal observations agree for
every plaintext `msg` and every Boolean predicate `P`. This is where
the UC indistinguishability content actually lives.

## How the observation lifts into `Interaction.UC.Semantics`

The bundled versions package the observation as a `Semantics T`:

* `realSmcSemantics sp readMsg P` reads a plaintext from the closed
  system via a user-supplied `readMsg : T.Closed → BitVec sp` and
  runs `realCipherObserve`. This is the environment's view under the
  real protocol.
* `idealSmcSemantics sp P` ignores the closed system beyond sampling
  a uniform ciphertext and runs `idealCipherObserve`. This is the
  environment's view under the simulator-wrapped ideal
  functionality.

Because the observation layer is the same for every closed system in
`T`, `realSmcSemantics_eq_idealSmcSemantics` states the lifted OTP
privacy claim:
`(realSmcSemantics sp readMsg P).evalDist W = (idealSmcSemantics sp P).evalDist W`
for every `W : T.Closed`. The UC indistinguishability statement
`observedCompEmulates_realSmcSemantics` then falls out: under the real SMC
semantics, any two closed systems are indistinguishable with
advantage zero.

## Open-world layer: three-port boundary `Δ_otp`

The second half of this file constructs an open UC-style model of
the OTP at a three-port boundary

```
Δ_otp sp = ⟨ keyIn +ᵢ plaintextIn , ctxtOut ⟩
```

where each port carries a `BitVec sp` message. Two structurally
distinct open processes live at this boundary:

* `realOtp sp msg`. Samples a uniform key `k ← BitVec sp` and emits
  the ciphertext `k ⊕ msg` on the `ctxtOut` port via
  `BoundaryAction.emit`.
* `idealOtp sp`. Samples a uniform ciphertext `c ← BitVec sp`
  directly and emits it verbatim on the `ctxtOut` port, ignoring the
  plaintext entirely.

Both processes thread a uniform sampler by lifting `Sampler.uniformI`
from `ProbComp` to `OptionT ProbComp` through `Decoration.map`. They
are structurally distinct whenever `msg ≠ 0` (`realOtp_ne_idealOtp`):
their single-step boundary emissions disagree on the zero key. The
indistinguishability statement `observedCompEmulates_realOtp` follows from
`observedCompEmulates_realSmcSemantics`, which closes over every pair of open
processes at every boundary.

/-- **Ideal-world OTP open process** at `Δ_otp sp`.

State space `Unit`. Every step samples a uniform ciphertext
`c ← BitVec sp` and emits `c` on the output port via `idealEmit`.
The plaintext input is never consulted: the simulator is realised
directly by the emission.

Distributional equivalence with `realOtp` is a theorem, not a
structural identity: OTP privacy (`evalDist_realCipherObserve_eq`)
collapses the two bundled `SPMF Unit` observations. -/

/-! ### UC indistinguishability at the open-world boundary -/

/-- **OTP UC indistinguishability at `Δ_otp sp`.**

For every plaintext reader and distinguisher predicate, the real and
ideal OTP open processes at the three-port boundary `Δ_otp sp` are
`ObservedCompEmulates 0`-indistinguishable under `realSmcSemantics`.

Since `observedCompEmulates_realSmcSemantics` quantifies over every pair of
open processes at every boundary, this follows directly. The content
lives one level down: OTP privacy
(`evalDist_realCipherObserve_eq`) collapses the real and ideal
bundled observations into the same `SPMF Unit`, regardless of what
open-world object is plugged into the closed system. -/
