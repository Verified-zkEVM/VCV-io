# VCV-io — AI Agent Guide

Formally verified cryptography proofs in Lean 4, built on Mathlib.

## Fast Start

1. Run `lake exe cache get && lake build`.
2. Read `Examples/OneTimePad.lean` for a compact modern proof (correctness and privacy).
3. Choose the work area by task: use `VCVio/` for oracle/probability/program-logic work, `LatticeCrypto/` for lattice schemes and reductions, and `LatticeCryptoTest/` for vectors or differential tests.
4. If probability lemmas fail unexpectedly, first check for `[spec.Fintype]` and `[spec.Inhabited]`.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical guide. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## Attribution, Headers, And Docstrings

Follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repo's explicit attribution policy.

- New Lean files should use the standard copyright / license / authors header and a module docstring.
- For ordinary Lean source files, use the standard prologue layout: header, blank line, imports, blank line, module docstring.
- Docstrings must be intrinsic and descriptive. Cross-reference live sibling definitions when helpful, but do not mention removed or renamed declarations, change history, or use reactive wording such as "replaces" or "renamed from".
- Preserve existing headers on routine edits.
- Only rewrite attribution when a file is genuinely new or materially replaced.
- Do not add a separate AI-attribution line.

## What This Project Is

VCV-io provides `OracleComp spec α`, a monadic type for oracle-access computations (free monad over `OracleSpec`), with `simulateQ` for operational semantics and `evalDist` for denotational semantics (probability distributions). `ProbComp α` is the abbreviation for `OracleComp unifSpec α`.

The repo also includes a first-class lattice cryptography library under `LatticeCrypto/`, built on top of the `VCVio` framework. That layer contains generic lattice algebra plus ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and Falcon specifications, security statements, concrete implementations, FFI bridges, and tests.

## Repo Map

- `VCVio/`: generic oracle-computation framework, program logic, crypto abstractions, and generic reductions.
- `LatticeCrypto/`: lattice-specific algebra, hardness assumptions, scheme definitions, security theorems, and concrete implementations.
- `LatticeCryptoTest/`: ACVP vectors, executable regression tests, and cross-checks against native backends.
- `Examples/`: compact framework examples such as OneTimePad, ElGamal, and Schnorr.
- `csrc/`: C FFI shims used for differential testing against native ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and Falcon code.
- `third_party/`: vendored native backends used by the FFI and test harnesses.

## Module Layering

For `VCVio/`:

```
ToMathlib → Prelude → EvalDist/Defs → OracleComp core → EvalDist bridge
  → {SimSemantics, QueryTracking, Constructions, Coercions, ProbComp}
  → {ProgramLogic, CryptoFoundations, CryptoFoundations/Asymptotics} → Examples
```

New files must respect this DAG. `EvalDist/` must never import from `OracleComp/`.

For `LatticeCrypto/`, the rough dependency direction is:

```
{Norm, Ring, Rounding, DiscreteGaussian}
  → HardnessAssumptions
  → {MLDSA, MLKEM, Falcon}
  → Concrete implementations / security wrappers
  → LatticeCryptoTest
```

Scheme-specific code in `LatticeCrypto/` may depend on `VCVio/CryptoFoundations`, but not the other way around.

## Critical Gotchas

1. **`[spec.Fintype]` and `[spec.Inhabited]`** are required for probability reasoning (`evalDist`, `Pr[...]`).
2. **`autoImplicit = false` is set globally in `lakefile.lean`**. Do not add `set_option autoImplicit false` in individual files. Every variable must be explicitly declared.
3. **`evalDist` IS `simulateQ`** with uniform distributions. This is definitional (`rfl`).
4. **`++ₒ` is dead** — use `+` for combining oracle specs.
5. **Commented-out code is legacy** — follow only uncommented code. Use `Examples/OneTimePad.lean` as canonical reference.
6. **Preserve partial proofs** with `stop` instead of deleting large proof blocks.

For the full list, see `docs/agents/gotchas.md`.

## Naming Conventions

Follow Mathlib convention: `{head_symbol}_{operation}_{rhs_form}`.
Examples: `probOutput_bind_eq_tsum`, `support_pure`, `simulateQ_map`.
Structures use UpperCamelCase: `SecExp`, `SymmEncAlg`, `RelTriple`.

## Program Logic Tactics

For new program-logic proofs, import `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics`.
`VCVio.ProgramLogic.Notation` keeps notation plus compatibility macros, but
`Tactics.lean` is the canonical interactive proof mode.

For the tactic reference, proof-mode entry points, and workflow details, see
[`docs/agents/program-logic.md`](docs/agents/program-logic.md).

## Building

```bash
lake exe cache get && lake build
```

After adding new `.lean` files: `./scripts/update-lib.sh`

Lean toolchain and Mathlib must stay in sync (both currently `v4.28.0`). Files should stay under 1500 lines.
