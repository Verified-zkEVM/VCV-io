# Rounding and Decomposition for Lattice Cryptography

This file defines the abstract rounding and decomposition operations used in lattice-based
signature schemes: `highBits`, `lowBits`, `power2Round`, `makeHint`, and `useHint`.
These operations are central to ML-DSA (FIPS 204 / CRYSTALS-Dilithium).

The interface is axiomatized following the EasyCrypt formalization in `DRing.eca`
(formosa-crypto/dilithium), which captures the minimal algebraic properties needed
for the security proof.

/-- Abstract rounding operations on a polynomial ring `Rq`, parameterized by a
rounding modulus `α` (typically `2 * γ₂` in ML-DSA). The `High` type represents
the image of `highBits`, and `Hint` represents the hint type for `useHint`.

The operations decompose ring elements into high-order and low-order parts,
and provide a hint mechanism for recovering the correct high-order bits from
a perturbed element. -/
